David Gries (born 26 April 1939 in Flushing, Queens, New York) is an American computer scientist at Cornell University, United States primarily known for his books, The Science of Programming (1981) and A Logical Approach to Discrete Math (1993, with Fred B. Schneider).
He is currently Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs in the Cornell University College of Engineering.  His research interests include programming methodology and related areas such as programming languages, programming language semantics, and logic. His son, Paul Gries, has been a co-author of an introductory textbook to computer programming using Python and is a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University.


== Life ==
Gries graduated from Queens College in 1960.  He spent the following two years working as a programmer-mathematician for the U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory, where he met his wife, Elaine.
Gries earned his Master's degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1963.  While at Illinois, Gries worked with Manfred Paul and Ruediger Wiehle to write a full ALGOL compiler for the IBM 7090 computer. He earned his Dr. Rer. Nat. in 1966 from the Munich University of Technology, studying under Friedrich L. Bauer and Joseph Stoer.
Gries was an assistant professor at Stanford University from 1966–1969 and then became an associate professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  He spent the next 30 years there, including a stint as Chair of the Computer Science department from 1982–1987.  He had a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984–1985.  He spent 1999–2002 at the University of Georgia in Athens and returned to Cornell in January 2003.
He is the author, co-author, or editor of seven textbooks and 75 research papers. David Gries currently lives in Ithaca, New York.
