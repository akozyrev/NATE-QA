    "topic": "Alan Turing",
    "content": [
      "Alan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist,  logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.",
      "Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.",
      "Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.",
      "Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, which was then a crime in the UK.",
      "During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.",
      "For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis.",
      "Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.",
      "Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.",
      "Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer.",
      "In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology.",
      "He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.",
      "Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK.",
      "He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison.",
      "Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.",
      "An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\".",
      "Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.",
      "The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.",
      "== Early life and education ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\nTuring was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.",
      "Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.",
      "John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.",
      "Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways.",
      "The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been  a general in the Bengal Army.",
      "However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale, London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel.",
      "Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between Hastings in England and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple.",
      "At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.",
      "The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.",
      "His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays.",
      "The location is also marked with a blue plaque.",
      "=== School ===\nTuring's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six.",
      "The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.",
      "Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).",
      "In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.",
      "The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics.",
      "His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools.",
      "If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated.",
      "If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school\".",
      "Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus.",
      "In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.",
      "=== Christopher Morcom ===\nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (1911 – 1930), who has been described as Turing's \"first love\".",
      "Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.",
      "The event caused Turing great sorrow.",
      "He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom.",
      "In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited.",
      "I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ...",
      "I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.",
      "Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthdays.",
      "A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (12 February, 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you.",
      "I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall [be] thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow.",
      "I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here.",
      "Your affectionate Alan.",
      "Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.",
      "Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death.",
      "In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected.",
      "When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.",
      "=== University and work on computability ===\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.",
      "In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.",
      "Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.",
      "A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college's Keynes Building on King's Parade.In 1936, Turing published his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\" (1936).",
      "In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines.",
      "The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928.",
      "Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm.",
      "He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.",
      "Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus, Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.",
      "It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus).",
      "According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable.",
      "John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.",
      "To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.",
      "From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University, in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow.",
      "In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.",
      "In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.",
      "John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to England.",
      "== Career and research ==\nWhen Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.",
      "The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.",
      "Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.",
      "=== Cryptanalysis ===\nDuring the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park.",
      "The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, \"You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius.",
      "\"From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation.",
      "He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.",
      "Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.",
      "The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940.",
      "Turing's approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish Bomba).",
      "On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.",
      "Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war.",
      "The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.",
      "By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject.",
      "He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions, which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth.",
      "A GCHQ mathematician, \"who identified himself only as Richard,\" said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis: [He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted \"shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject\".",
      "The papers detailed using \"mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible.\"",
      "... Richard said that GCHQ had now \"squeezed the juice\" out of the two papers and was \"happy for them to be released into the public domain\".",
      "Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park.",
      "He was known to his colleagues as \"Prof\" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the \"Prof's Book\".",
      "According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:\n\nIn the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off.",
      "His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals.",
      "Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand.",
      "Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.",
      "While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for meetings, and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.",
      "Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury.",
      "His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes.",
      "He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.In 1946, Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.",
      "=== Bombe ===\n\nWithin weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived.",
      "The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.",
      "The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext.",
      "For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant), the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next.",
      "Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail.",
      "A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma.",
      "The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated.",
      "Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals.",
      "In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments.",
      "They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named.",
      "They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.",
      "As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, \"This letter had an electric effect.\"",
      "Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: \"ACTION THIS DAY.",
      "Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.\"",
      "On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.",
      "The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, \"All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.\"",
      "More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.",
      "=== Hut 8 and the naval Enigma ===\nTuring decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma \"because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\".",
      "In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.That same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, \"though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken.\"",
      "For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban.",
      "Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.",
      "Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipherTuring travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.",
      "Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:\n\nThe American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order.",
      "I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.",
      "Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices.",
      "Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.",
      "During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.",
      "He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943.",
      "During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section).",
      "Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution:\n\nThere should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success.",
      "In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe.",
      "It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing.",
      "The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.",
      "=== Turingery ===\nIn July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine.",
      "This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park.",
      "Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.",
      "He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.",
      "Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer.",
      "Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.",
      "=== Delilah ===\nFollowing his work at Bell Labs in the US, Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system.",
      "In the latter part of the war, he moved in order to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park.",
      "At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley.",
      "Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah.",
      "The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions.",
      "In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war.",
      "Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.",
      "Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.",
      "=== Early computers and the Turing test ===\n\nBetween 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).",
      "He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.",
      "Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it \"contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own\".",
      "Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned.",
      "In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.",
      "While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence.",
      "It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15.",
      "The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.",
      "It took place in Göttingen in 1947.",
      "The interrogation had the form of a colloquium.",
      "Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).",
      "In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester.",
      "A year later, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1.",
      "Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.",
      "He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.",
      "During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics, and in \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called \"intelligent\".",
      "The idea was that a computer could be said to \"think\" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.",
      "In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education.",
      "A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.",
      "In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G.",
      "Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist.",
      "By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turbochamp.",
      "In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program.",
      "Instead, Turing \"ran\" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move.",
      "The game was recorded.",
      "According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program \"played a recognizable game of chess.\"",
      "The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife,\nIsabel.His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.",
      "=== Pattern formation and mathematical biology ===\nWhen Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in January 1952.",
      "He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms.",
      "Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis, the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures.",
      "He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction-diffusion system, could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".",
      "He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions.",
      "For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations.",
      "Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A.",
      "If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did.",
      "To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand.",
      "These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots.",
      "The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics.",
      "Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.",
      "One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.",
      "Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of \"feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.\"",
      "In 2012, Sheth, et al.",
      "found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.",
      "Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992.",
      "== Personal life ==\nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived.",
      "After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.",
      "=== Conviction for indecency ===\nIn January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man.",
      "Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch.",
      "On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled.",
      "Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police.",
      "During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray.",
      "Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.",
      "Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.",
      "Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.",
      "The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.",
      "Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido.",
      "He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this treatment was continued for the course of one year.",
      "The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia, fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out\".",
      "Murray was given a conditional discharge.Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job.",
      "He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.",
      "Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work.",
      "=== Death ===\nOn 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead; he had died the previous day.",
      "Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.",
      "When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.",
      "An inquest determined that he had committed suicide.",
      "Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale.",
      "Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.\"",
      "Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954 and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict.",
      "He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons.",
      "The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold.",
      "Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room.",
      "Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison.",
      "Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.",
      "In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) \"with good humour\" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death.",
      "He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend.",
      "Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.",
      "Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment in order to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability in regard to any suicide claims.",
      "Conspiracy theorists pointed out that Turing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death.",
      "The secret services feared that communists would entrap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence.",
      "Turing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holidayed in European countries near the Iron Curtain.",
      "It is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ.",
      "Turing believed in extrasensory perception, and it has been suggested that his belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood.",
      "As a youth, Turing had been told by a gypsy fortune-teller that he would be a genius.",
      "Shortly before his death, during a day-trip to St Annes-on Sea with the Greenbaum family, Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller.",
      "According to the Greenbaums' daughter, Barbara:But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool.",
      "We found a fortune-teller's tent and Alan said he'd like to go in so we waited around for him to come back... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face.",
      "Something had happened.",
      "We don't know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy.",
      "I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide.\"",
      "=== Government apology and pardon ===\n\nIn August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.",
      "The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.",
      "The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as \"appalling\":\nThousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated.",
      "While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ...",
      "So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.",
      "In December 2011, William Jones created an e-petition requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of \"gross indecency\":\nWe ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of \"gross indecency\".",
      "In 1952, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called \"organo-therapy\"—chemical castration.",
      "Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41.",
      "Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save.",
      "This remains a shame on the British government and British history.",
      "A pardon can go some way to healing this damage.",
      "It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws.",
      "The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures, and was supported by Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who said:\nA posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence.",
      "He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted.",
      "It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort.",
      "However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.",
      "John Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament and campaigned with Jones to secure the pardon.",
      "Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was \"ultimately just embarrassing\" that the conviction still stood.",
      "Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed.At the UK premiere of a film based on Turing's life, The Imitation Game, the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing's pardon.",
      "His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime.",
      "Leech's campaign gained public support from leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking.On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.",
      "Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.",
      "The government indicated it would support the bill, and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October.At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage.",
      "The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014, but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons, the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy.",
      "On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for \"gross indecency\", with immediate effect.",
      "Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be \"remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort\" and not for his later criminal conviction.",
      "The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.",
      "The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.",
      "Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.In a letter to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons.",
      "Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing's death:\n\nA new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others).",
      "I think murder by state agents is unlikely.",
      "There is no known evidence pointing to any such act.",
      "However, it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated.",
      "In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an \"Alan Turing law\".",
      "The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.",
      "The law applies in England and Wales.",
      "== Awards, honours, and tributes ==\n\nTuring was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire 1946.",
      "He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.",
      "Several things are named in his honour:\n\n\n=== Posthumous tributes ===\nVarious institutions have paid tribute to Turing by naming things after him including:\n\nA biography published by the Royal Society shortly after Turing's death, while his wartime work was still subject to the Official Secrets Act, recorded:\n\n Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three diverse mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time.",
      "For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.",
      "Since 1966, the Turing Award has been given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community.",
      "It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.",

      "A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street.",
      "The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park.",
      "Turing is shown holding an apple.",
      "The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.",
      "However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the 'u' in 'computer' matches up with the 'u' in 'ADXUO'.",
      "As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.",
      "A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'.",
      "There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation: \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.\"",
      "The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to \"the godfather of all modern computers\".In 1999, Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and stated, \"The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.",

    "content": [
      "In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm ( (listen)) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.",
      "Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.",
      "As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function.",
      "Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state.",
      "The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries.",
      "Greek mathematicians used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers, and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.The word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th century mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized Algoritmi.",
      "A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert in 1928.",
      "Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"effective calculability\" or \"effective method\".",
      "Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939.",
      "== Etymology ==\nThe word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in a first step to algorismus.",
      "Al-Khwārizmī (Arabic: الخوارزمي‎,  Persian: خوارزمی‎, c. 780–850) was a Persian  mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, whose name means 'the native of Khwarazm', a region that was part of Greater Iran and is now in Uzbekistan.About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an Arabic language treatise on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which was translated into Latin during the 12th century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum.",
      "This title means \"Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians\", where \"Algoritmi\" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name.",
      "Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the Algebra.",
      "In late medieval Latin, algorismus, English 'algorism', the corruption of his name, simply meant the \"decimal number system\".",
      "In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (cf.",
      "'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus, and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391.",
      "English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that \"algorithm\" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.",
      "Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled Carmen de Algorismo composed by Alexandre de Villedieu.",
      "It begins thus:\n\nHaec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.",
      "which translates as:\n\nAlgorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.",
      "The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.",
      "== Informal definition ==\n\nAn informal definition could be \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\".",
      "which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations.",
      "Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.A prototypical example of an algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the flowchart above and as an example in a later section.",
      "Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:\n\nNo human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †\"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons\") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation.",
      "But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give explicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set, for arbitrary finite n. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.",
      "An \"enumerably infinite set\" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers.",
      "Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that \"creates\" output integers from an arbitrary \"input\" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large.",
      "Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y = m + n – two arbitrary \"input variables\" m and n that produce an output y.",
      "But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):\n\nPrecise instructions (in language understood by \"the computer\") for a fast, efficient, \"good\" process that specifies the \"moves\" of \"the computer\" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities) to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols m and n, symbols + and = ... and \"effectively\" produce, in a \"reasonable\" time, output-integer y at a specified place and in a specified format.The concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidability.",
      "That notion is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules.",
      "In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension.",
      "From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.",
      "== Formalization ==\nAlgorithms are essential to the way computers process data.",
      "Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards.",
      "Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a Turing-complete system.",
      "Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):\n\n Minsky: \"But we will also maintain, with Turing ... that any procedure which could \"naturally\" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine.",
      "Although this may seem extreme, the arguments ... in its favor are hard to refute\".",
      "Gurevich: \"...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine\".",
      "Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing.",
      "Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm.",
      "In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.",
      "For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise.",
      "That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).",
      "Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm.",
      "Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting \"from the top\" and going \"down to the bottom\", an idea that is described more formally by flow of control.",
      "So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming.",
      "This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, \"mechanical\" means.",
      "Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable.",
      "It derives from the intuition of \"memory\" as a scratchpad.",
      "There is an example below of such an assignment.",
      "For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see functional programming and logic programming.",
      "=== Expressing algorithms ===\nAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters).",
      "Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms.",
      "Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements.",
      "Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.",
      "There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at finite-state machine, state transition table and control table), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see more at state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called \"sets of quadruples\" (see more at Turing machine).",
      "Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:\n1 High-level description\n\"...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details.",
      "At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.\"",
      "2 Implementation description\n\"...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape.",
      "At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function.\"",
      "3 Formal description\nMost detailed, \"lowest level\", gives the Turing machine's \"state table\".For an example of the simple algorithm \"Add m+n\" described in all three levels, see Algorithm#Examples.",
      "== Design ==\n\nAlgorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms.",
      "The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.",
      "Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns, such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.",
      "One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its Big O.",
      "Typical steps in the development of algorithms:\n\nProblem definition\nDevelopment of a model\nSpecification of the algorithm\nDesigning an algorithm\nChecking the correctness of the algorithm\nAnalysis of algorithm\nImplementation of algorithm\nProgram testing\nDocumentation preparation\n\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs.",
      "However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.",
      "== Computer algorithms ==\n\nIn computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended \"target\" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input.",
      "An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.",
      "\"Elegant\" (compact) programs, \"good\" (fast) programs : The notion of \"simplicity and elegance\" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:\n\nKnuth: \" ... we want good algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense.",
      "One criterion ... is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm .... Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc\"Chaitin: \" ... a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does\"Chaitin prefaces his definition with: \"I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'\"—such a proof would solve the Halting problem (ibid).",
      "Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm: For a given function multiple algorithms may exist.",
      "This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer.",
      "Rogers observes that \"It is ... important to distinguish between the notion of algorithm, i.e.",
      "procedure and the notion of function computable by algorithm, i.e.",
      "mapping yielded by procedure.",
      "The same function may have several different algorithms\".Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant.",
      "An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.",
      "Computers (and computors), models of computation: A computer (or human \"computor\") is a restricted type of machine, a \"discrete deterministic mechanical device\" that blindly follows its instructions.",
      "Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable locations, (ii) discrete, indistinguishable counters (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are effective relative to the capability of the agent.Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's \"abacus\" model in his \"Very Simple Bases for Computability\".",
      "Minsky's machine proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence.",
      "Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three assignment (replacement, substitution) operations: ZERO (e.g.",
      "the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g.",
      "L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g.",
      "L ← L − 1).",
      "Rarely must a programmer write \"code\" with such a limited instruction set.",
      "But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is Turing complete with only four general types of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language: Knuth advises the reader that \"the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it .",
      "immediately take pen and paper and work through an example\".",
      "But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing?",
      "The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can effectively execute.",
      "Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root.",
      "If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.This means that the programmer must know a \"language\" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).",
      "But what model should be used for the simulation?",
      "Van Emde Boas observes \"even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains.",
      "It is at this point that the notion of simulation enters\".",
      "When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters.",
      "For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a \"modulus\" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's \"decrement\").",
      "Structured programming, canonical structures: Per the Church–Turing thesis, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT.",
      "Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"spaghetti code\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".",
      "Tausworthe augments the three Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures: SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.",
      "An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.Canonical flowchart symbols: The graphical aide called a flowchart, offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one).",
      "Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down.",
      "Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie).",
      "The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes.",
      "Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure.",
      "The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.",
      "== Examples ==\n\n\n=== Algorithm example ===\n\nOne of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order.",
      "Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list.",
      "From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description in English prose, as:\nHigh-level description:\n\nIf there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.",
      "Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.",
      "For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.",
      "When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.",
      "(Quasi-)formal description:\nWritten in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:\n\n\n=== Euclid's algorithm ===\n\nEuclid's algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII (\"Elementary Number Theory\") of his Elements.",
      "Euclid poses the problem thus: \"Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure\".",
      "He defines \"A number [to be] a multitude composed of units\": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero.",
      "To \"measure\" is to place a shorter measuring length s successively (q times) along longer length l until the remaining portion r is less than the shorter length s. In modern words, remainder r = l − q×s, q being the quotient, or remainder r is the \"modulus\", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).",
      "Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another.",
      "Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a reductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the greatest.",
      "While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number \"1\" for their common measure.",
      "So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.",
      "==== Computer language for Euclid's algorithm ====\nOnly a few instruction types are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.",

      "In rapid succession the following appeared: Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene and J.B. Rosser's λ-calculus a finely honed definition of \"general recursion\" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of Jacques Herbrand (cf.",
      "Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.",
      "Church's proof that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, Emil Post's definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.",
      "Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his \"a- [automatic-] machine\"—in effect almost identical to Post's \"formulation\", J. Barkley Rosser's definition of \"effective method\" in terms of \"a machine\".",
      "S.C. Kleene's proposal of a precursor to \"Church thesis\" that he called \"Thesis I\", and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis \"Church's Thesis\" and proposing \"Turing's Thesis\".",
      "=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===\nEmil Post (1936) described the actions of a \"computer\" (human being) as follows:\n\n\"...two concepts are involved: that of a symbol space in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable set of directions.His symbol space would be\n\n\"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes...",
      "The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.",
      "\"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point.",
      "...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke.",
      "Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...\"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem.",
      "This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]\".",
      "See more at Post–Turing machine\nAlan Turing's work preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing.",
      "Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: \"Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'\".",
      "Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.",
      "Turing—his model of computation is now called a Turing machine—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and \"states of mind\".",
      "But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.",
      "\"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper.",
      "We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares.",
      "I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...\"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his \"state of mind\" at that moment.",
      "We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment.",
      "If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations.",
      "We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...\"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided.",
      "\"Turing's reduction yields the following:\n\n\"The simple operations must therefore include:\n\"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares\n\"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.",
      "\"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind.",
      "The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:\n\n\"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.",
      "\"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind\"\"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer.",
      "\"A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:\n\n\"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process.",
      "Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition ... [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] ... We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine.",
      "It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines.",
      "The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability ... .",
      "\"† We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions\".",

Barkley Rosser defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):\n\n\"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps.",

      "She founded the Institute for Women and Technology and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.",
      "== Education and early life ==\nBorg was born Anita Borg Naffz in Chicago, Illinois.",
      "She grew up in Palatine, Illinois; Kaneohe, Hawaii; and Mukilteo, Washington.",
      "Borg got her first programming job in 1969.",
      "Although she loved math while growing up, she did not originally intend to go into computer science and taught herself to program while working at a small insurance company.",
      "She was awarded a PhD in Computer Science by New York University in 1981 for research investigating the synchronization efficiency of operating systems supervised by Robert Dewar and Gerald Belpaire.",
      "== Career ==\nAfter receiving her PhD, Borg spent four years building a fault tolerant Unix-based operating system, first for Auragen Systems Corp. of New Jersey and then with Nixdorf Computer in Germany.In 1986, she began working for Digital Equipment Corporation, where she spent 12 years, first at the Western Research Laboratory.",
      "While at Digital Equipment, she developed and patented a method for generating complete address traces for analyzing and designing high-speed memory systems.",
      "Her experience running the ever-expanding Systers mailing list, which she founded in 1987, led her to work in email communication.",
      "As a consultant engineer in the Network Systems Laboratory under Brian Reid, she developed MECCA, an email and Web-based system for communicating in virtual communities.In 1997, Borg left Digital Equipment Corporation and began working as a researcher in the Office of the Chief Technology Officer at Xerox PARC.",
      "Soon after starting at Xerox, she founded the Institute for Women and Technology, having previously founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 1994.",
      "=== Advocacy for technical women ===\nBorg passionately believed in working for greater representation of technical women.",
      "Her goal was to have 50% representation for women in computing by 2020.",
      "She strove for technical fields to be places where women would be equally represented at all levels of the pipeline, and where women could impact, and benefit from, technology.",
      "=== Systers ===\nIn 1987, Borg founded Systers, the first email network for women in technology.",
      "While attending the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP), she was struck by how few women were present at the conference.",
      "She and six or seven other women met in the ladies' room and talked about how few women there were in computing.",
      "A dozen of the women at the conference made plans to eat lunch together, and that is where the idea for Systers was formed.Systers was established to provide a private space for its members to seek input and share advice based on their common experiences.",
      "Systers membership was limited to women with highly technical training and discussions were strictly confined to technical issues.",
      "Borg oversaw Systers until 2000.",
      "Systers occasionally tackled issues that were not highly technical but pertained to its members.",
      "In 1992, when Mattel Inc. began selling a Barbie doll that said math class is tough, the voices of protest that started with the Systers list played a role in getting Mattel to remove that phrase from Barbie's microchip.",
      "=== Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing ===\nIn 1994, Anita Borg and Telle Whitney founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.",

      "The first Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing was held in Washington, D.C., in June 1994, and brought together 500 technical women.",
      "=== Institute for Women and Technology ===\nIn 1997, Borg founded the Institute for Women and Technology (now the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology).",
      "Two important goals behind the founding of the organization were to increase the representation of women in technical fields and to enable the creation of more technology by women.",
      "When founded, the Institute was housed at Xerox PARC, although it was an independent nonprofit organization.",
      "The Institute was created to be an experimental R&D organization focusing on increasing the impact of women on technology and increasing the impact of technology on the world's women.",
      "It ran a variety of programs to increase the role of technology, build the pipeline of technical women, and ensure that women's voices affected technological developments.In 2002, Telle Whitney took over as President and CEO of the Institute, and in 2003, it was renamed in honor of Borg.",
      "Since its foundation, the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology has increased its programs in the United States and expanded internationally, more than quadrupling in size.",
      "=== Awards and recognition ===\nBorg was recognized for her accomplishments as a computer scientist, as well as for her work on behalf of women in computing.",
      "She received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award from the Association for Women in Computing for her work on behalf of women in the computing field in 1995.",
      "In 1996 she was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "In 1999, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Presidential Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology.",
      "She was charged with recommending strategies to the nation for increasing the breadth of participation fields for women.In 2002, she was awarded the 8th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment.",
      "Also in 2002, Borg received an Honorary Doctor of Science and Technology degree from Carnegie Mellon University\nBorg received the EFF Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and was recognized by the Girl Scouts of the USA, as well as listed on Open Computing Magazine's Top 100 Women in Computing.",
      "Borg was also a member of the board of directors of the Computing Research Association and served as a member of the National Research Council's Committee on Women in Science and Engineering.",
      "=== Legacy ===\nIn 1999, Borg was diagnosed with a brain tumor.",
      "She continued to lead the Institute for Women and Technology until 2002.",
      "She died on April 6, 2003, in Sonoma, California.In 2003, the Institute for Women and Technology was renamed to the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, in honor of Borg.Several other awards and programs honor Borg's life and work.",
      "Google established the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship in 2004 to honor the work of Borg.",

      "The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer app\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program.",
      "VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.",

      "The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package.",
      "It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.",
      "The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.",
      "In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier..",
      "In fact it was Jobs himself who had convinced Sculley to join Apple using the famous lines \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"",
      "The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to \"contain\" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products.",

      "After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits.",
      "Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet.",
      "Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power.",
      "Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée's mantra of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points.",
      "The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products.",
      "The Christmas season of 1989 is the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.",
      "Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990.",
      "Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the Macintosh Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.",
      "In 1991, Apple introduced the PowerBook, replacing the \"luggable\" Macintosh Portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops.",
      "The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities.",
      "It remained the architectural basis for the Classic Mac OS.",
      "The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.",
      "For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.",
      "The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.Apple believed the Apple II series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.",
      "In October 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC, and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.",
      "The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.",
      "=== 1991–1997: Decline and restructuring ===\n\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines.",
      "To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets.",
      "These were the high-end Quadra, the mid-range Centris line, and the ill-fated Performa series.",
      "This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances.",
      "Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.",
      "Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.",
      "Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.",
      "The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.",
      "At this time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple's reputation, and Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.",
      "By the late 1980s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to System 6, such as A/UX and Pink.",
      "The System 6 platform itself was outdated because it was not originally built for multitasking.",
      "By the 1990s, Apple was facing competition from OS/2 and UNIX vendors such as Sun Microsystems.",
      "System 6 and 7 would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on modern hardware.In 1994, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software.",
      "The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft's monopoly.",
      "The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's PowerPC processor.In 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO.",
      "Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.",
      "After numerous failed attempts to modernize Mac OS, first with the Pink project from 1988 and later with Copland from 1994, Apple in 1997 purchased NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system and to bring Steve Jobs back.",
      "Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy when Jobs returned.",

      "On July 9, 1997, Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.",
      "Jobs acted as the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line; it was during this period that he identified the design talent of Jonathan Ive, and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild Apple's status.On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the Macintosh 128K: the iMac.",
      "The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the iPod and the iPhone.",
      "The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.During this period, Apple completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers.",
      "In 1998, Apple purchased Macromedia's Key Grip software project, signaling an expansion into the digital video editing market.",
      "The sale was an outcome of Macromedia's decision to solely focus upon web development software.",
      "The product, still unfinished at the time of the sale, was renamed \"Final Cut Pro\" when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.",
      "The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.",
      "Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte, which had developed DVD authoring technology, as well as Astarte's corresponding products and engineering team in April 2000.",
      "Astarte's digital tool DVDirector was subsequently transformed into the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product.",
      "Apple then employed the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.",
      "In July 2001, Apple acquired Spruce Technologies, a PC DVD authoring platform, to incorporate their technology into Apple's expanding portfolio of digital video projects.SoundJam MP, released by Casady & Greene in 1998, was renamed \"iTunes\" when Apple purchased it in 2000.",
      "The primary developers of the MP3 player and music library software moved to Apple as part of the acquisition, and simplified SoundJam's user interface, added the ability to burn CDs, and removed its recording feature and skin support.",
      "SoundJam was Apple's second choice for the core of Apple's music software project, originally codenamed iMusic, behind Panic's Audion.",
      "Apple was not able to set up a meeting with Panic in time to be fully considered as the latter was in the middle of similar negotiations with AOL.In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake, as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic.",
      "The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company.",
      "The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.",
      "The release of iPhoto in the same year completed the iLife suite.Mac OS X, based on NeXT's OPENSTEP and BSD Unix, was released on March 24, 2001, after several years of development.",
      "Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface.",
      "To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.On May 19, 2001, Apple opened its first official eponymous retail stores in Virginia and California.",
      "On October 23 of the same year, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player.",
      "The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.",
      "In 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced.",
      "The service offered online music downloads for $0.99 a song and integration with the iPod.",
      "The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.",
      "Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.",
      "==== Intel transition and financial stability ====\n\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Mac computers in 2006.",
      "On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU.",
      "By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.",
      "The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.",
      "On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.",
      "Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price.",
      "Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.",
      "When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006, Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.",
      "Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".Although Apple's market share in computers had grown, it remained far behind its competitor Microsoft Windows, accounting for about 8% of desktops and laptops in the US.Since 2001, Apple's design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the iMac G3.",
      "This design change began with the titanium-made PowerBook and was followed by the iBook's white polycarbonate structure and the flat-panel iMac.",
      "=== 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices ===\n\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as \"Apple Inc.\", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.",
      "This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV.",
      "The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales, and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".",
      "Apple would achieve widespread success with its iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad products, which introduced innovations in mobile phones, portable music players, and personal computers respectively.",
      "Furthermore, by early 2007, 800,000 Final Cut Pro users were registered.In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.",
      "On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.",

      "The official press release explained that Apple was \"scaling back\" on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health.",
      "In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".",

      "After years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010.",
      "The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad.",
      "This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release.",
      "Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US.",
      "It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.",

      "In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.",

      "==== Lack of innovation ====\nAn editorial article in The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has \"matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design\" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products.",
      "He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring.",
      "But it's also how Apple does business.",
      "[...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\".",
      "He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\".",
      "Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that Walkman didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity).",
      "He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on Siri, its virtual personal assistant, has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality.",
      "Whereas Google and Amazon make use of big data and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong pro-privacy stance, intentionally not retaining user data.",
      "\"Siri is a textbook of leading on something in tech and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the Journal.",
      "The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies.",
      "Though switching Siri's functions to machine learning and algorithms, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's Echo, which features the Alexa personal assistant.",
      "Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions.",
      "While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's Assistant had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.In December 2017, two articles from The Verge and ZDNet debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms.",
      "The former had experienced a severe security vulnerability, in which Macs running the then-latest macOS High Sierra software were vulnerable to a bug that let anyone gain administrator privileges by entering \"root\" as the username in system prompts, leaving the password field empty and twice clicking \"unlock\", gaining full access.",
      "The bug was publicly disclosed on Twitter, rather than through proper bug bounty programs.",
      "Apple released a security fix within a day and issued an apology, stating that \"regrettably we stumbled\" in regards to the security of the latest updates.",
      "After installing the security patch, however, file sharing was broken for users, with Apple releasing a support document with instructions to separately fix that issue.",
      "Though Apple publicly stated the promise of \"auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again\", users who installed the security update while running the older 10.13.0 version of the High Sierra operating system rather than the then-newest 10.13.1 release experienced that the \"root\" security vulnerability was re-introduced, and persisted even after fully updating their systems.",
      "On iOS, a date bug caused iOS devices that received local app notifications at 12:15am on December 2, 2017 to repeatedly restart.",
      "Users were recommended to turn off notifications for their apps.",
      "Apple quickly released an update, done during the nighttime in Cupertino, California time and outside of their usual software release window, with one of the headlining features of the update needing to be delayed for a few days.",
      "The combined problems of the week on both macOS and iOS caused The Verge's Tom Warren to call it a \"nightmare\" for Apple's software engineers and described it as a significant lapse in Apple's ability to protect its more than 1 billion devices.",
      "ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes wrote that \"it's hard to not come away from the last week with the feeling that Apple is slipping\".",
      "Kingsley-Hughes also concluded his piece by referencing an earlier article, in which he wrote that \"As much as I don't want to bring up the tired old 'Apple wouldn't have done this under Steve Jobs's watch' trope, a lot of what's happening at Apple lately is different from what they came to expect under Jobs.",
      "Not to say that things didn't go wrong under his watch, but product announcements and launches felt a lot tighter for sure, as did the overall quality of what Apple was releasing.\"",
      "He did, however, also acknowledge that such failures \"may indeed have happened\" with Jobs in charge, though returning to the previous praise for his demands of quality, stating \"it's almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled, which limits future failures\".",

      "The figures attracted international scorn, and were labelled by Nobel-prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, as leprechaun economics.",
      "It was not until 2018 that Irish economists could definitively prove that the 2015 growth was due to Apple restructuring its controversial double Irish subsidiaries (Apple Sales International), which Apple converted into a new Irish capital allowances for intangible assets tax scheme (expires in January 2020).",
      "The affair required the Central Bank of Ireland to create a new measure of Irish economic growth, Modified GNI* to replace Irish GDP, given the distortion of Apple's tax schemes.",

      "In computer science,  artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.",
      "Computer science defines AI research as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.",
      "Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is used to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.",
      "A quip in Tesler's Theorem says \"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\"",
      "For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.",
      "Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.",
      "Artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types of systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence.",
      "Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence; generating a cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions.",
      "Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive and emotional intelligence; understanding human emotions, in addition to cognitive elements, and considering them in their decision making.",
      "Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence), is able to be self-conscious and is self-aware in interactions with others.",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.",
      "For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.",
      "These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g.",
      "\"robotics\" or \"machine learning\"), the use of particular tools (\"logic\" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.",
      "Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.",
      "General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.",
      "Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.",
      "Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.",
      "The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.",
      "The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".",
      "This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence which are issues that have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.",
      "Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.",
      "Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.",
      "== History ==\n\nThought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.",
      "(Rossum's Universal Robots).",
      "These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.",
      "The study of mathematical logic led directly to  Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.",
      "This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis.",
      "Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.",
      "Turing proposed that \"if a human could not distinguish between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered \"intelligent\".",
      "The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\".The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.",
      "Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.",
      "They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.",
      "By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.",
      "AI's founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".",
      "Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks.",
      "Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI.",
      "The next few years would later be called an \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.",
      "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.",
      "By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars.",
      "At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.",
      "However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.",
      "The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.",
      "Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.In 2011, a Jeopardy!",
      "quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy!",
      "champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.",
      "Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.",
      "The Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.",
      "In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.",
      "In the 2017 Future of Go Summit,  AlphaGo  won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No.",
      "1 ranking for two years.",
      "This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is an extremely complex game, more so than Chess.",
      "According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.",
      "Clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011.",
      "He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.",
      "Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.",
      "In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had \"incorporated AI in some offerings or processes\".",
      "Around 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an \"AI superpower\".",
      "== Basics ==\nA typical AI analyses its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.",
      "An AI's intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (\"1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Do mathematically similar actions to the ones succeeded in the past\").",
      "Goals can be explicitly defined, or induced.",
      "If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.",
      "Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similarly to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.",
      "Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.",
      "Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.AI often revolves around the use of algorithms.",
      "An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.",
      "A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms.",
      "A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:\nIf someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square.",
      "Otherwise,\nif a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move.",
      "Otherwise,\ntake the center square if it is free.",
      "Otherwise,\nif your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner.",
      "Otherwise,\ntake an empty corner if one exists.",
      "Otherwise,\ntake any empty square.Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.",
      "Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.",
      "These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data.",
      "In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially.",
      "Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.",
      "For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding an pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): \"If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza\".",
      "A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\".",
      "The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\".",
      "A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial \"neurons\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful.",
      "These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies.",
      "Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.",
      "Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future.",
      "These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\".",
      "They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is an Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist\".",
      "Learners also work on the basis of \"Occam's razor\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest.",
      "Therefore, to be successful, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.",
      "Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting.",
      "Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.",
      "Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\".",
      "A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.",
      "A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects.",
      "Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.",
      "Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human \"commonsense reasoning\"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about \"naïve physics\" such as space, time, and physical interactions.",
      "This enables even young children to easily make inferences like \"If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor\".",
      "Humans also have a powerful mechanism of \"folk psychology\" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as \"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence\".",
      "(A generic AI has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence.)",
      "This lack of \"common knowledge\" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible.",
      "For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.",
      "== Problems ==\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner.",
      "The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems.",
      "These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.",
      "The traits described below have received the most attention.",
      "=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.",
      "By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.These algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.",
      "In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.",
      "They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements.",
      "=== Knowledge representation ===\n\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to classical AI research.",
      "Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain.",
      "In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world.",
      "Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains.",
      "A representation of \"what exists\" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.",
      "The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language.",
      "The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).",
      "Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\n\nDefault reasoning and the qualification problem\nMany of the things people know take the form of \"working assumptions\".",
      "For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies.",
      "None of these things are true about all birds.",
      "John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions.",
      "Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires.",
      "AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.",
      "The breadth of commonsense knowledge\nThe number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large.",
      "Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.",
      "The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge\nMuch of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally.",
      "For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\" or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.",
      "These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.",
      "Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge.",
      "As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI, computational intelligence, or statistical AI will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.",
      "=== Planning ===\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.",
      "They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or \"value\") of available choices.In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.",
      "However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty.",
      "This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.Multi-agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal.",
      "Emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence.",
      "=== Learning ===\n\nMachine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first.",
      "Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first.",
      "Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories.",
      "Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.",
      "Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\".",
      "Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.",
      "In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones.",
      "The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.",
      "=== Natural language processing ===\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and understand human language.",
      "A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts.",
      "Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering and machine translation.",
      "Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text.",
      "\"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\".",
      "\"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to assess the sentiment of a document.",
      "Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well.",
      "Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications.",
      "Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.",
      "=== Perception ===\n\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.",
      "Applications include speech recognition, facial recognition, and object recognition.",
      "Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.",
      "Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.",
      "=== Motion and manipulation ===\n\nAI is heavily used in robotics.",
      "Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.",
      "A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.",
      "Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into \"primitives\" such as individual joint movements.",
      "Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object.",
      "Moravec's paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\".",
      "This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.",
      "=== Social intelligence ===\n\nMoravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence.",
      "Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.",
      "Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human affects.",
      "Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.In the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent.",
      "Being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions.",
      "Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.",
      "Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.",
      "=== General intelligence ===\n\nHistorically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition.",
      "These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI.",
      "Nowadays, the vast majority of current AI researchers work instead on tractable \"narrow AI\" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation).",
      "Many researchers predict that such \"narrow AI\" work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas.",
      "Many advances have general, cross-domain significance.",
      "One high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning.",
      "Besides transfer learning, hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out how to \"slurp up\" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured Web.",
      "Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, \"Master Algorithm\" could lead to AGI.",
      "Finally, a few \"emergent\" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do.",
      "For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages (NLP), follow the author's argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent (social intelligence).",
      "A problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.",
      "== Approaches ==\nThere is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research.",
      "Researchers disagree about many issues.",
      "A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology?",
      "Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering?",
      "Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)?",
      "Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?",
      "=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurobiology, information theory, and cybernetics.",
      "Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast.",
      "Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England.",
      "By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.",
      "=== Symbolic ===\n\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.",
      "The research was centered in three institutions: Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford and MIT, and as described below, each one developed its own style of research.",
      "John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"GOFAI\".",
      "During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs.",
      "Approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.",
      "Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.",
      "==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science.",
      "Their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems.",
      "This tradition, centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 1980s.",
      "==== Logic-based ====\nUnlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless whether people used the same algorithms.",
      "His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.",
      "Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.",
      "==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====\nResearchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert) found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions—they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior.",
      "Roger Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\" (as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms at CMU and Stanford).",
      "Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat's Cyc) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.",
      "==== Knowledge-based ====\nWhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.",
      "This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.",
      "A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI.",
      "The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.",
      "=== Sub-symbolic ===\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.",
      "A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.",
      "Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.",
      "==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes embodied, situated, behavior-based, and nouvelle AI.",
      "Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.",
      "Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early cybernetics researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of control theory in AI.",
      "This coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.",
      "Within developmental robotics, developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).",
      "==== Computational intelligence and soft computing ====\nInterest in neural networks and \"connectionism\" was revived by David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.",
      "Artificial neural networks are an example of soft computing—they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient.",
      "Other soft computing approaches to AI include fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many statistical tools.",
      "The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence.",
      "=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results.",
      "However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMM), information theory, and normative Bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures.",
      "The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).",
      "Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining, without necessarily acquiring semantic understanding of the datasets.",
      "The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more scientific.",
      "Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.",
      "Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.",
      "Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from Explainable AI.",
      "In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.",
      "=== Integrating the approaches ===\nIntelligent agent paradigm\nAn intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.",
      "The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems.",
      "More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms).",
      "The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\".",
      "An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works—some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic artificial neural networks and others may use new approaches.",
      "The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents.",
      "Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty.",
      "The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.Agent architectures and cognitive architectures\nResearchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system.",
      "A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.",
      "Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as Soar, are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence.",
      "Modern extensions of Soar are hybrid intelligent systems that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.",
      "== Tools ==\nAI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.",
      "A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.",
      "=== Search and optimization ===\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions: Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search.",
      "For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.",
      "Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.",
      "Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.",
      "Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.",
      "Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers.",
      "The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.",
      "The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps.",
      "In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\").",
      "Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.",
      "Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization.",
      "For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made.",
      "These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top.",
      "Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.",
      "Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search.",
      "For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).",
      "Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.",
      "Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms.",
      "Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).",
      "=== Logic ===\n\nLogic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well.",
      "For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.Several different forms of logic are used in AI research.",
      "Propositional logic involves truth functions such as \"or\" and \"not\".",
      "First-order logic adds quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other.",
      "Fuzzy set theory assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false.",
      "Fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system.",
      "Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.",
      "Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics; situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time); causal calculus; belief calculus; and modal logics.Overall, qualitiative symbolic logic is brittle and scales poorly in the presence of noise or other uncertainty.",
      "Exceptions to rules are numerous, and it is difficult for logical systems to function in the presence of contradictory rules.",
      "=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===\n\nMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information.",
      "AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).",
      "Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).",
      "Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive.",
      "For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another.",
      "Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected cycles) can require a sophisticated method such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities.",
      "Bayesian networks are used on Xbox Live to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is.",
      "AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.A key concept from the science of economics is \"utility\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent.",
      "Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory.",
      "These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.",
      "=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\").",
      "Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems.",
      "Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match.",
      "They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI.",
      "These examples are known as observations or patterns.",
      "In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class.",
      "A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made.",
      "All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set.",
      "When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches.",
      "The decision tree is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.",
      "Other widely used classifiers are the neural network,k-nearest neighbor algorithm,kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM),Gaussian mixture model, and the extremely popular naive Bayes classifier.",
      "Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise.",
      "Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data.",
      "Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.",
      "=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\nNeural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain.",
      "A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from multiple other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate.",
      "Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another.",
      "The net forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\".",
      "Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.",
      "Modern neural nets can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations.",
      "Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.",
      "In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.The study of non-learning artificial neural networks began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of Walter Pitts and Warren McCullouch.",
      "Frank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of linear regression.",
      "Early pioneers also include Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, Teuvo Kohonen, Stephen Grossberg, Kunihiko Fukushima, Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, Shun-Ichi Amari, Bernard Widrow, John Hopfield, Eduardo R. Caianiello, and others.",
      "The main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events).",
      "Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.",
      "Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), GMDH or competitive learning.Today, neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa, and was introduced to neural networks by Paul Werbos.Hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.To summarize, most neural networks use some form of gradient descent on a hand-created neural topology.",
      "However, some research groups, such as Uber, argue that simple neuroevolution to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches.",
      "One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in \"dead ends\".",
      "==== Deep feedforward neural networks ====\n\nDeep learning is any artificial neural network that can learn a long chain of causal links.",
      "For example, a feedforward network with six hidden layers can learn a seven-link causal chain (six hidden layers + output layer) and has a \"credit assignment path\" (CAP) depth of seven.",
      "Many deep learning systems need to be able to learn chains ten or more causal links in length.",
      "Deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and others.According to one overview, the expression \"Deep Learning\" was introduced to the Machine Learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986 and gained traction after\nIgor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to Artificial Neural Networks in 2000.",
      "The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965.",
      "These networks are trained one layer at a time.",
      "Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks.",
      "In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning.",
      "Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships.",
      "Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.",
      "In 1989, Yann LeCun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture.",
      "In the early 2000s, in an industrial application CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.",
      "Since 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have\nwon many visual pattern recognition competitions.CNNs with 12 convolutional layers were used in conjunction with reinforcement learning by Deepmind's \"AlphaGo Lee\", the program that beat a top Go champion in 2016.",
      "==== Deep recurrent neural networks ====\n\nEarly on, deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are in theory Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.",
      "The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence; thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.",
      "RNNs can be trained by gradient descent but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.",
      "In 1992, it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems.Numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997.",
      "LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC).",
      "At Google, Microsoft and Baidu this approach has revolutionised speech recognition.",
      "For example, in 2015, Google's speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through Google Voice to billions of smartphone users.",
      "Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation, Language Modeling and Multilingual Language Processing.",
      "LSTM combined with CNNs also improved automatic image captioning and a plethora of other applications.",
      "=== Evaluating progress ===\n\nAI, like electricity or the steam engine, is a general purpose technology.",
      "There is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks AI tends to excel at.",
      "While projects such as AlphaZero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch, many other machine learning projects require large training datasets.",
      "Researcher Andrew Ng has suggested, as a \"highly imperfect rule of thumb\", that \"almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.\"",
      "Moravec's paradox suggests that AI lags humans at many tasks that the human brain has specifically evolved to perform well.Games provide a well-publicized benchmark for assessing rates of progress.",
      "AlphaGo around 2016 brought the era of classical board-game benchmarks to a close.",
      "Games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to AI in the area of game theory.",
      "E-sports such as StarCraft continue to provide additional public benchmarks.",
      "There are many competitions and prizes, such as the Imagenet Challenge, to promote research in artificial intelligence.",
      "The most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, robotic cars, and robot soccer as well as conventional games.The \"imitation game\" (an interpretation of the 1950 Turing test that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human) is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark.",
      "A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).",
      "As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human.",
      "In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine.",
      "A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test.",
      "Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test.",
      "A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.Proposed \"universal intelligence\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible.",
      "At an extreme, the test suite can contain every possible problem, weighted by Kolmogorov complexity; unfortunately, these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern-matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels.",
      "== Applications ==\n\nAI is relevant to any intellectual task.",
      "Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.",
      "Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays, prediction of judicial decisions and targeting online advertisements.With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution, major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.",
      "=== Healthcare ===\n\nAI is being applied to the high cost problem of dosage issues—where findings suggested that AI could save $16 billion.",
      "In 2016, a ground breaking study in California found that a mathematical formula developed with the help of AI correctly determined the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients.",
      "Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors.",
      "According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.",
      "There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer.",
      "In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer.",
      "This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients.",
      "Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called \"Hanover\".",
      "Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient.",
      "One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades.",
      "Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers.",
      "Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.",
      "One study was done with transfer learning, the machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a well-trained ophthalmologist, and could generate a decision within 30 seconds on whether or not the patient should be referred for treatment, with more than 95% percent accuracy.According to CNN, a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot.",
      "The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed.",
      "IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the IBM Watson, which has beaten human intelligence (at some levels).",
      "Watson not only won at the game show Jeopardy!",
      "against former champions, but was declared a hero after successfully diagnosing a woman who was suffering from leukemia.",
      "=== Automotive ===\n\nAdvancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles.",
      "As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of driverless cars.",
      "A few companies involved with AI include Tesla, Google, and Apple.Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars.",
      "These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping.",
      "Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.Recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though they are still in the testing phase.",
      "The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018.",
      "Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet.",
      "Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway.One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less automobile to function is mapping.",
      "In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven.",
      "This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings.",
      "However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.",
      "Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.Another factor that is influencing the ability for a driver-less automobile is the safety of the passenger.",
      "To make a driver-less automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations.",
      "These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians.",
      "The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car.",
      "But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger.",
      "In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.",
      "The programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driver-less automobile.",
      "=== Finance and economics ===\nFinancial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation.",
      "The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards.",

      "Can it \"think\"?",
      "Alan Turing's \"polite convention\"\nWe need not decide if a machine can \"think\"; we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being.",

      "(See Dreyfus' critique of AI.",
      ")Gödelian arguments\nGödel himself, John Lucas (in 1961) and Roger Penrose (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own \"Gödel statements\" and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical Turing machines.",
      "However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that these \"Gödelian arguments\" fail.The artificial brain argument\nThe brain can be simulated by machines and because brains are intelligent, simulated brains must also be intelligent; thus machines can be intelligent.",

      "When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, the machine was acting intelligently.",
      "However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not \"real\" intelligence after all; thus \"real\" intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still cannot.",

      "==== Existential risk ====\n\nPhysicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".",
      "The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.",
      "Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate.",

      "Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.",
      "==== Devaluation of humanity ====\n\nJoseph Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy was deeply misguided.",
      "Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position is now known as computationalism).",
      "To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.",
      "==== Social justice ====\nOne concern is that AI programs may be programmed to be biased against certain groups, such as women and minorities, because most of the developers are wealthy Caucasian men.",
      "Support for artificial intelligence is higher among men (with 47% approving) than women (35% approving).",
      "==== Decrease in demand for human labor ====\n\nThe relationship between automation and employment is complicated.",
      "While automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs through micro-economic and macro-economic effects.",
      "Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".",
      "Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".",
      "Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.",
      "Author Martin Ford and others go further and argue that a large number of jobs are routine, repetitive and (to an AI) predictable; Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades, and that many of the new jobs may not be \"accessible to people with average capability\", even with retraining.",
      "Economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.",
      "==== Autonomous weapons ====\n\nCurrently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones.",
      "=== Ethical machines ===\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world.",
      "Research in this area includes machine ethics, artificial moral agents, and friendly AI.",
      "==== Artificial moral agents ====\nWendell Wallach introduced the concept of artificial moral agents (AMA) in his book Moral Machines For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\" and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".",
      "For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the constraints which society may place on the development of AMAs.",
      "==== Machine ethics ====\n\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.",
      "The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines.",
      "In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning.",
      "The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines.",
      "Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this.",
      "In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines.",
      "Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence.",
      "Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"",
      "Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.",
      "A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\" that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.",
      "==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====\n\nPolitical scientist Charles T. Rubin believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.",
      "He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\"",
      "Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share).",
      "Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop.",
      "This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.",
      "One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is 'Friendly AI', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs.",
      "Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.",
      "Leading AI researcher Rodney Brooks writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years.",
      "I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"",
      "=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be sentient—will it have a mind which has conscious experiences?",
      "This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.",
      "==== Consciousness ====\n\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.",
      "The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior.",
      "The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all.",
      "Human information processing is easy to explain, however human subjective experience is difficult to explain.",
      "For example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\".",
      "The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red.",
      "The hard problem is that people also know something else—they also know what red looks like.",
      "(Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.)",
      "Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like).",
      "The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different than knowledge and other aspects of the brain.",
      "==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.",
      "Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem.",
      "This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.",
      "==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n\nThe philosophical position that John Searle has named \"strong AI\" states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"",
      "Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.",
      "==== Robot rights ====\n\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel?",
      "If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human?",
      "This issue, now known as \"robot rights\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.",
      "Some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.",
      "The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film Plug & Pray.",
      "=== Superintelligence ===\n\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines—or human-machine hybrids—can be?",
      "A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.",
      "Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.",
      "==== Technological singularity ====\n\nIf research into Strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself.",
      "The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement.",
      "The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans.",
      "Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario \"singularity\".",
      "Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization.",
      "Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.",
      "==== Transhumanism ====\n\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.",
      "This idea, called transhumanism, which has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.",
      "Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.",
      "== In fiction ==\n\nThought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,\nand have been a persistent theme in science fiction.",
      "A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters.",
      "This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999).",
      "In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name.",
      "Asimov's laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.Transhumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.",
      "In the 1980s, artist Hajime Sorayama's Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later \"the Gynoids\" book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including George Lucas and other creatives.",
      "Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.",
      "Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental of question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer.",
      "This appears in Karel Čapek's \"R.U.R.",
      "\", the films \"A.I.",
      "Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Ex Machina\",  as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick.",

      "Early on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.",
      "When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.",
      "The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school and wrote his first software program.",
      "When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.",
      "Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest.",
      "He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer.",
      "Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.",
      "When he reflected back on that moment, he said, \"There was just something neat about the machine.\"",
      "After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers.",
      "One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time.",
      "Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language.",
      "The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business.",
      "The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties.",

      "I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].\"",
      "== Microsoft ==\n\n\n=== BASIC ===\n\nAfter Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.",
      "In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest.",
      "MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter.",
      "The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC.",
      "Paul Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975.",
      "Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\" (a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\"), with their first office located in Albuquerque.",

      "Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.",
      "Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed.",
      "In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.",
      "This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment.",
      "Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.",
      "The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business.",
      "Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well.",

      "=== IBM partnership ===\nIBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.",
      "IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter.",
      "When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.",
      "IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement.",
      "IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system.",
      "A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.",
      "Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS.",
      "After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.",
      "They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.",
      "Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer.",
      "PC Magazine asked if Gates was \"the man behind the machine?",
      "\", and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating \"it's Gates' computer\".",

      "Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times.",
      "When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game.",

      "He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\"",
      "and \"Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"",
      "The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.",
      "When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.",

      "He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, \"Something else impressed me.",
      "Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.",

      "He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.",

      "Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions.",
      "As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, \"Did I fence with Boies?",

      "Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers.",
      "Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with the help of specialized graphical hardware and software.",
      "It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science.",
      "The phrase was coined in 1960, by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing.",
      "It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI).",
      "Some topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite graphics, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surface visualization with ray tracing, and computer vision, among others.",
      "The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, and physics.",
      "Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer.",
      "It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world.",
      "Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design in general.",
      "== Overview ==\nThe term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe \"almost everything on computers that is not text or sound\".",
      "Typically, the term computer graphics refers to several different things:\n\nthe representation and manipulation of image data by a computer\nthe various technologies used to create and manipulate images\nthe sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see study of computer graphicsToday, computer graphics is widespread.",
      "Such imagery is found in and on television, newspapers, weather reports, and in a variety of medical investigations and surgical procedures.",
      "A well-constructed graph can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret.",
      "In the media \"such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, theses\", and other presentation material.Many tools have been developed to visualize data.",
      "Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics.",
      "As technology has improved, 3D computer graphics have become more common, but 2D computer graphics are still widely used.",
      "Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.",
      "Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization, and scientific visualization more concerned with \"the visualization of three dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.",
      "), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component\".",
      "== History ==\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place during the first half of the twentieth century.",
      "Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive.",
      "The first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, was invented in 1897 – it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel – the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input.",
      "Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-World War II period – during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further development of technologies like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war.",
      "New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading to the development of computer graphics as a discipline.",
      "=== 1950s ===\n\nEarly projects like the Whirlwind and SAGE Projects introduced the CRT as a viable display and interaction interface and introduced the light pen as an input device.",
      "Douglas T. Ross of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in  which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope.",
      "One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics – Tennis for Two – was created for an oscilloscope by William Higinbotham to entertain visitors in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and simulated a tennis match.",
      "In 1959, Douglas T. Ross innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated 3D machine tool vectors by taking the opportunity to create a display scope image of a Disney cartoon character.Electronics pioneer Hewlett-Packard went public in 1957 after incorporating the decade prior, and established strong ties with Stanford University through its founders, who were alumni.",
      "This began the decades-long transformation of the southern San Francisco Bay Area into the world's leading computer technology hub - now known as Silicon Valley.",
      "The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.",
      "Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics.",
      "In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.",
      "The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces.",
      "A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software.",
      "Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later.",
      "The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip.",
      "This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it.",
      "By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment.",
      "Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location.",
      "Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced.",
      "Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program.",
      "One example of this is in drawing constraints.",
      "If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box.",
      "One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box.",
      "The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location.",
      "Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects.",
      "In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car.",
      "It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.",
      "=== 1960s ===\n\nThe phrase \"computer graphics\" itself was coined in 1960 by William Fetter, a graphic designer for Boeing.",
      "This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence:\n\nFetter has said that the terms were actually given to him by Verne Hudson of the Wichita Division of Boeing.In 1961 another student at MIT, Steve Russell, created another important title in the history of video games, Spacewar!.",
      "Written for the DEC PDP-1, Spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy.",
      "The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it.",
      "The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the \"world's first video game\" for their new customers.",
      "(Higginbotham's Tennis For Two had beaten Spacewar by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.)",
      "E. E. Zajac, a scientist at Bell Telephone Laboratory (BTL), created a film called \"Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system\" in 1963.",
      "In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth.",
      "He created the animation on an IBM 7090 mainframe computer.",
      "Also at BTL, Ken Knowlton, Frank Sinden and Michael Noll started working in the computer graphics field.",
      "Sinden created a film called Force, Mass and Motion illustrating Newton's laws of motion in operation.",
      "Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research.",
      "At Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Nelson Max created the films Flow of a Viscous Fluid and Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form.",
      "Boeing Aircraft created a film called Vibration of an Aircraft.",
      "Also sometime in the early 1960s, automobiles would also provide a boost through the early work of Pierre Bézier at Renault, who used Paul de Casteljau's curves - now called Bézier curves after Bézier's work in the field - to develop 3d modeling techniques for Renault car bodies.",
      "These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves - unlike polygons - are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.",
      "It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics.",
      "TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s.",
      "IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer.",
      "Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey.",
      "While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen.",
      "It was the first consumer computer graphics product.",
      "David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley.",
      "There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people.",
      "In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest.",
      "This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.",
      "Also in 1966, Ivan Sutherland continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled head-mounted display (HMD).",
      "Called the Sword of Damocles because of the hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye.",
      "This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D.",
      "After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard.",
      "In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah - a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field.",
      "There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research.",
      "At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.",
      "In 1968, Arthur Appel described the first algorithm for what would eventually become known as ray casting - a basis point for almost all of modern 3D graphics, as well as the later pursuit of photorealism in graphics.",
      "In 1969, the ACM initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics (SIGGRAPH) which organizes conferences, graphics standards, and publications within the field of computer graphics.",
      "By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization.",
      "SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.",
      "=== 1970s ===\n\nAn astonishing number of the breakthroughs in the field in this decade - particularly many important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic - occurred at the University of Utah in the 1970s, which had hired Ivan Sutherland.",
      "Sutherland was paired with David C. Evans to teach an advanced computer graphics class, which contributed a great deal of founding research to the field and taught several students who would grow to found several of the industry's most important companies - namely Pixar, Silicon Graphics, and Adobe Systems.",
      "One of these students was Edwin Catmull.",
      "Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and had been working on his degree in physics.",
      "Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing.",
      "Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution.",
      "The first animation that Catmull saw was his own.",
      "He created an animation of his hand opening and closing.",
      "He also pioneered texture mapping to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in 3D modeling.",
      "It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics - a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in Pixar.",
      "In the same class, Fred Parke created an animation of his wife's face.",
      "As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, John Warnock was another of those early pioneers; he would later found Adobe Systems and create a revolution in the publishing world with his PostScript page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard photo editing software in Adobe Photoshop and a prominent movie industry special effects program in Adobe After Effects.",
      "Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab.",
      "James Clark was also there; he would later found Silicon Graphics.",
      "A major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers - hidden surface determination.",
      "In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are \"behind\" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be \"hidden\" when the computer creates (or renders) the image.",
      "The 3D Core Graphics System (or Core) was the first graphical standard to be developed.",
      "A group of 25 experts of the ACM Special Interest Group SIGGRAPH developed this \"conceptual framework\".",
      "The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future developments in the field.",
      "Also in the 1970s, Henri Gouraud, Jim Blinn and Bui Tuong Phong contributed to the foundations of shading in CGI via the development of the Gouraud shading and Blinn-Phong shading models, allowing graphics to move beyond a \"flat\" look to a look more accurately portraying depth.",
      "Jim Blinn also innovated further in 1978 by introducing bump mapping, a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today.",
      "The modern videogame arcade as is known today was birthed in the 1970s, with the first arcade games using real-time 2D sprite graphics.",
      "Pong in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games.",
      "Speed Race in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically scrolling road.",
      "Gun Fight in 1975 featured human-looking sprite character graphics, while Space Invaders in 1978 featured a large number of sprites on screen; both used an Intel 8080 microprocessor and Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics.",
      "=== 1980s ===\n\nThe 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics.",
      "As the home computer proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly.",
      "In the early 1980s, the availability of bit-slice and 16-bit microprocessors started to revolutionize high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations.",
      "Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers.",
      "Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from Bell-Northern Research, and led by David Pearson, an early workstation pioneer.",
      "The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system.",
      "It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector.",
      "Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh, as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods.",
      "The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses.",
      "Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use graphical user interfaces (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text.",
      "Graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology.",
      "In the field of realistic rendering, Japan's Osaka University developed the LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System, a supercomputer that used up to 257 Zilog Z8001 microprocessors, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic 3D computer graphics.",
      "According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: \"The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, light source, and object position.",
      "The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing.",
      "By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images.",
      "It was used to create the world's first 3D planetarium-like video of the entire heavens that was made completely with computer graphics.",
      "The video was presented at the Fujitsu pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in Tsukuba.\"",
      "The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful computer, as of 1984.",
      "Also in the field of realistic rendering, the general rendering equation of David Immel and James Kajiya was developed in 1986 - an important step towards implementing global illumination, which is necessary to pursue photorealism in computer graphics.",
      "The continuing popularity of Star Wars and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic became known as the \"go-to\" house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film.",
      "Important advances in chroma keying (\"bluescreening\", etc.)",
      "were made for the later films of the original trilogy.",
      "Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: Dire Straits' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song \"Money for Nothing\" in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from Young Sherlock Holmes the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass knight).",
      "In 1988, the first shaders - small programs designed specifically to do shading as a separate algorithm - were developed by Pixar, which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity - though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade.",
      "In the late 1980s, SGI computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated short films at Pixar, and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.",
      "The 1980s is also called the golden era of videogames; millions-selling systems from Atari, Nintendo and Sega, among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience - as did MS-DOS-based personal computers, Apple IIs and Macs, and Amigas, which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough.",
      "In the arcades, advances were made in commercial, real-time 3D graphics.",
      "In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D graphics boards were introduced in arcades, with the Namco System 21 and Taito Air System.",

      "=== 1990s ===\n\nThe 1990s' overwhelming note was the emergence of 3D modeling on a mass scale and an impressive rise in the quality of CGI generally.",
      "Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as 3D modelers became available for home systems, the popularity of Silicon Graphics workstations declined and powerful Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh machines running Autodesk products like 3D Studio or other home rendering software ascended in importance.",
      "By the end of the decade, the GPU would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today.",
      "The field began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as photorealistic to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and 3D graphics became far more popular in gaming, multimedia, and animation.",
      "At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: La Vie des bêtes by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), Les Fables Géométriques (1989-1991) by studio Fantôme, and Quarxs, the first HDTV computer graphics series by Maurice Benayoun and François Schuiten (studio Z-A production, 1990–1993).",
      "In film, Pixar began its serious commercial rise in this era under Edwin Catmull, with its first major film release, in 1995 - Toy Story - a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude.",
      "The studio to invent the programmable shader would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trail breaker.",
      "In video games, in 1992, Virtua Racing, running on the Sega Model 1 arcade system board, laid the foundations for fully 3D racing games and popularized real-time 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience in the video game industry.",
      "The Sega Model 2 in 1993 and Sega Model 3 in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics.",
      "Back on the PC, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, three of the first massively popular 3D first-person shooter games, were released by id Software to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated primarily by John Carmack.",
      "The Sony Playstation, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64, among other consoles, sold in the millions and popularized 3D graphics for home gamers.",
      "Certain late-90's first-generation 3D titles became seen as influential in popularizing 3D graphics among console users, such as platform games Super Mario 64 and The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time, and early 3D fighting games like Virtua Fighter, Battle Arena Toshinden, and Tekken.",
      "Technology and algorithms for rendering continued to improve greatly.",
      "In 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented normal mapping - an improvement on Jim Blinn's bump mapping.",
      "1999 saw Nvidia release the seminal GeForce 256, the first home video card billed as a graphics processing unit or GPU, which in its own words contained \"integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines\".",
      "By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as DirectX and OpenGL.",
      "Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful graphics hardware and 3D modeling software.",
      "AMD also became a leading developer of graphics boards in this decade, creating a \"duopoly\" in the field which exists this day.",
      "=== 2000s ===\n\nCGI became ubiquitous in earnest during this era.",
      "Video games and CGI cinema had spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s.",
      "CGI was also adopted en masse for television advertisements widely in the late 1990s and 2000s, and so became familiar to a massive audience.",
      "The continued rise and increasing sophistication of the graphics processing unit were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for desktop computer makers to offer.",
      "The Nvidia GeForce line of graphics cards dominated the market in the early decade with occasional significant competing presence from ATI.",
      "As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as Nvidia and AMD both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market.",
      "Shaders which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved texture and shading in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of normal mapping, bump mapping, and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.",
      "Computer graphics used in films and video games gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the uncanny valley.",
      "CGI movies proliferated, with traditional animated cartoon films like Ice Age and Madagascar as well as numerous Pixar offerings like Finding Nemo dominating the box office in this field.",
      "The Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.",
      "The film was not a box-office success, however.",
      "Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the \"uncanny valley\".",
      "Other animated films like The Polar Express drew attention at this time as well.",
      "Star Wars also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film.",
      "In videogames, the Sony PlayStation 2 and 3, the Microsoft Xbox line of consoles, and offerings from Nintendo such as the GameCube maintained a large following, as did the Windows PC.",
      "Marquee CGI-heavy titles like the series of Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, Final Fantasy, BioShock, Kingdom Hearts, Mirror's Edge and dozens of others continued to approach photorealism, grow the video game industry and impress, until that industry's revenues became comparable to those of movies.",
      "Microsoft made a decision to expose DirectX more easily to the independent developer world with the XNA program, but it was not a success.",
      "DirectX itself remained a commercial success, however.",
      "OpenGL continued to mature as well, and it and DirectX improved greatly; the second-generation shader languages HLSL and GLSL began to be popular in this decade.",
      "In scientific computing, the GPGPU technique to pass large amounts of data bidirectionally between a GPU and CPU was invented; speeding up analysis on many kinds of bioinformatics and molecular biology experiments.",
      "The technique has also been used for Bitcoin mining and has applications in computer vision.",
      "=== 2010s ===\n\nIn the early half of the 2010s, CGI is nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically photorealistic, and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.",
      "Texture mapping has matured into a multistage process with many layers; generally, it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, bump mapping or isosurfaces, normal mapping, lighting maps including specular highlights and reflection techniques, and shadow volumes into one rendering engine using shaders, which are maturing considerably.",
      "Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating pixels, vertices, and textures on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects.",
      "Their shader languages HLSL and GLSL are active fields of research and development.",
      "Physically based rendering or PBR, which implements even more maps to simulate real optic light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced optics areas like subsurface scattering and photon mapping.",
      "Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in real time at ultra-high-resolution modes like 4K Ultra HD are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.",
      "In cinema, most animated movies are CGI now; a great many animated CGI films are made per year, but few, if any, attempt photorealism due to continuing fears of the uncanny valley.",
      "Most are 3D cartoons.",
      "In videogames, the Microsoft Xbox One, Sony PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch currently dominate the home space and are all capable of highly advanced 3D graphics; the Windows PC is still one of the most active gaming platforms as well.",
      "== Image types ==\n\n\n=== Two-dimensional ===\n\n2D computer graphics are the computer-based generation of digital images—mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them.",
      "2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies such as typography.",
      "In those applications, the two-dimensional image is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than 3D computer graphics, whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography.",
      "==== Pixel art ====\n\nA large form of digital art, pixel art is created through the use of raster graphics software, where images are edited on the pixel level.",
      "Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, graphing calculator games, and many mobile phone games are mostly pixel art.",
      "==== Sprite graphics ====\n\nA sprite is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene.",
      "Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory bitmap of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.",
      "Originally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a screen, such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the data defining the overall screen.",
      "Such sprites can be created by either electronic circuitry or software.",
      "In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a hardware construct that employs custom DMA channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources.",
      "Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.",
      "==== Vector graphics ====\n\nVector graphics formats are complementary to raster graphics.",
      "Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for the representation of photographic images.",
      "Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering.",
      "There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice.",
      "There are times when both formats come together.",
      "An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.",
      "=== Three-dimensional ===\n\n3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data.",
      "For the purpose of performance, this is stored in the computer.",
      "This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.",
      "Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar algorithms as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display.",
      "In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.",
      "3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models.",
      "The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering.",
      "However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object.",
      "Until visually displayed a model is not graphic.",
      "Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space.",
      "3D rendering is how a model can be displayed.",
      "Also can be used in non-graphical computer simulations and calculations.",
      "=== Computer animation ===\n\nComputer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers.",
      "It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation.",
      "Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs.",
      "Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.",
      "It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.",
      "Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix.",
      "Animation is the change of an attribute over time.",
      "Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated.",
      "The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation.",
      "Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up).",
      "To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer screen then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly.",
      "This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in television and motion pictures.",
      "== Concepts and principles ==\nImages are typically created by devices such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc.",
      "Digital images include both vector images and raster images, but raster images are more commonly used.",
      "=== Pixel ===\n\nIn digital imaging, a pixel (or picture element) is a single point in a raster image.",
      "Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares.",
      "Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original.",
      "The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three\ncomponents such as red, green, and blue.",
      "Graphics are visual presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen.",
      "Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images.",
      "Graphics often combine text and illustration.",
      "Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element.",
      "Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.",
      "=== Primitives ===\nPrimitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models.The example is Examples would be sprites and character maps in 2d video games, geometric primitives in CAD, or polygons or triangles in 3d rendering.",
      "Primitives may be supported in hardware for efficient rendering, or the building blocks provided by a graphics application.",
      "=== Rendering ===\nRendering is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs.",
      "A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as a description of the virtual scene.",
      "The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file.",
      "The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs.",
      "The term \"rendering\" may be by analogy with an \"artist's rendering\" of a scene.",
      "Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device, such as a GPU.",
      "A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations.",
      "If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the rendering equation.",
      "The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery.",
      "'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.",
      "3D projection\n3D projection is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane.",
      "As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.Ray tracing\nRay tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane.",
      "The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of photorealism; usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.Shading\nShading refers to depicting depth in 3D models or illustrations by varying levels of darkness.",
      "It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas.",
      "There are various techniques of shading including cross hatching where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area.",
      "The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears.",
      "Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears.",
      "The term has been recently generalized to mean that shaders are applied.Texture mapping\nTexture mapping is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model.",
      "Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974.",
      "A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon.",
      "This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box.",
      "Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.",
      "Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates.",
      "Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.Anti-aliasing\nRendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a liquid-crystal display or CRT television inevitably causes aliasing artifacts mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called \"jaggies\".",
      "Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive.",
      "Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as supersampling) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used.",
      "A pre-anti-aliased bitmap texture being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any procedurally defined texture will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as mipmapping and texture filtering help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.",
      "=== Volume rendering ===\n\nVolume rendering is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set.",
      "A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a CT or MRI scanner.",
      "Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern.",
      "This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.",
      "=== 3D modeling ===\n\n3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, wireframe representation of any three-dimensional object, called a \"3D model\", via specialized software.",
      "Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting.",
      "3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, polygonal mesh modeling (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh subdivision (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models).",
      "A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering, used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes.",
      "The model can also be physically created using 3D Printing devices.",
      "== Pioneers in computer graphics ==\nCharles Csuri\nCharles Csuri is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964.",
      "Csuri was recognized by Smithsonian as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and Association for Computing Machinery-SIGGRAPH.Donald P. Greenberg\nDonald P. Greenberg is a leading innovator in computer graphics.",
      "Greenberg has authored hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists, animators, and researchers such as Robert L. Cook, Marc Levoy, Brian A. Barsky, and Wayne Lytle.",
      "Many of his former students have won Academy Awards for technical achievements and several have won the SIGGRAPH Achievement Award.",
      "Greenberg was the founding director of the NSF Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization.A.",
      "Michael Noll\nNoll was one of the first researchers to use a digital computer to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random processes in the creation of visual arts.",
      "He began creating digital art in 1962, making him one of the earliest digital artists.",
      "In 1965, Noll along with Frieder Nake and Georg Nees were the first to publicly exhibit their computer art.",
      "During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by Bela Julesz.",

      "In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment.",
      "Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.",
      "He started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\".",
      "\"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable.",
      "In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first computer program.",
      "Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM.",
      "In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit.",
      "When the machine was finished, some hailed it as \"Babbage's dream come true\".During the 1940s, as new and more powerful computing machines were developed, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.",
      "As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general.",
      "In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City.",
      "The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science.",
      "The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world.",
      "Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and the university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.",
      "Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.",
      "The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953.",
      "The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.",
      "Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.",
      "Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.",
      "It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time.",
      "IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709 computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices.",
      "\"Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again\".",
      "During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology.",
      "Modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology, from usage only by experts and professionals, to a near-ubiquitous user base.",
      "Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of humanitarian aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators.",
      "As computer adoption became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.",
      "=== Contributions ===\n\nDespite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with electronics, it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the Information Age and a driver of the information revolution, seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the Industrial Revolution (1750–1850 CE) and the Agricultural Revolution (8000–5000 BC).",
      "These contributions include:\n\nThe start of the \"Digital Revolution\", which includes the current Information Age and the Internet.",
      "A formal definition of computation and computability, and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems.",
      "The concept of a programming language, a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction.",
      "In cryptography, breaking the Enigma code was an important factor contributing to the Allied victory in World War II.",
      "Scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity, as well as experimentation entirely by software.",
      "It also enabled advanced study of the mind, and mapping of the human genome became possible with the Human Genome Project.",
      "Distributed computing projects such as Folding@home explore protein folding.",
      "Algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale.",
      "High frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility.",
      "Computer graphics and computer-generated imagery have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, cinema, advertising, animation and video games.",
      "Even films that feature no explicit CGI are usually \"filmed\" now on digital cameras, or edited or post-processed using a digital video editor.",
      "Simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others.",
      "Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft.",
      "Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs.",
      "The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.",
      "Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex.",
      "There are many applications of AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as robotic vacuum cleaners.",
      "It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and squad support robots.",
      "Human–computer interaction combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, ease in learning, and high satisfaction.",
      "Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs, then conduct usability tests to refine designs.",
      "Key innovations include the direct manipulation, selectable web links, touchscreen designs, mobile applications, and virtual reality.",
      "== Etymology ==\n\nAlthough first proposed in 1956, the term \"computer science\" appears in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,\nin which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in 1921, justifying the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.",
      "His efforts, and those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe, were rewarded: universities went on to create such programs, starting with Purdue in 1962.",
      "Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves.",
      "Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.",
      "Certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference.",
      "Danish scientist Peter Naur suggested the term datalogy, to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers.",
      "The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy.",
      "The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries.",
      "An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is now used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.",
      "Also, in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the Communications of the ACM—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, and applied epistemologist.",
      "Three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by hypologist.",
      "The term computics has also been suggested.",
      "In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression \"automatic information\" (e.g.",
      "\"informazione automatica\" in Italian) or \"information and mathematics\" are often used, e.g.",
      "informatique (French), Informatik (German), informatica (Italian, Dutch), informática (Spanish, Portuguese), informatika (Slavic languages and Hungarian) or pliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in Greek.",
      "Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh).",
      "\"In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.",
      "\"A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—Edsger Dijkstra, states that \"computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\"",
      "The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science.",
      "For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering, while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems.",
      "However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines.",
      "Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, statistics, and logic.",
      "Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.",
      "Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Rózsa Péter and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.The relationship between Computer Science and Software Engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term \"Software Engineering\" means, and how computer science is defined.",
      "David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis.",
      "Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science.",
      "Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.",
      "== Philosophy ==\n\nA number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.",
      "Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.",
      "Peter Denning's working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.",
      "Amnon H. Eden described them as the \"rationalist paradigm\" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the \"technocratic paradigm\" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the \"scientific paradigm\" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence).",
      "== Fields ==\n\nAs a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS)—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture.",
      "In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.",
      "=== Theoretical computer science ===\n\nTheoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation.",
      "Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.",
      "All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.",
      "==== Data structures and algorithms ====\n\nData structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.",
      "==== Theory of computation ====\n\nAccording to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, \"What can be (efficiently) automated?\"",
      "Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations.",
      "In an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation.",
      "The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.",
      "The famous P = NP?",
      "problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems, is an open problem in the theory of computation.",
      "==== Information and coding theory ====\n\nInformation theory is related to the quantification of information.",
      "This was developed by Claude Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.",
      "Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application.",
      "Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding.",
      "Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.",
      "==== Programming language theory ====\n\nProgramming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features.",
      "It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics.",
      "It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.",
      "==== Formal methods ====\n\nFormal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.",
      "The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.",
      "They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved.",
      "Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing.",
      "For industrial use, tool support is required.",
      "However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance.",
      "Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.",
      "=== Computer systems ===\n\n\n==== Computer architecture and computer engineering ====\n\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.",
      "It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.",
      "The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.",
      "==== Computer performance analysis ====\n\nComputer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving throughput, controlling response time, using resources efficiently, eliminating bottlenecks, and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads.Benchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different chip/system architectures.",
      "==== Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems ====\n\nConcurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.",
      "A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi and the Parallel Random Access Machine model.",
      "A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network.",
      "Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal.",
      "==== Computer networks ====\n\nThis branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.",
      "==== Computer security and cryptography ====\n\nComputer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.",
      "Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information.",
      "Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.",
      "==== Databases ====\n\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily.",
      "Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages.",
      "=== Computer applications ===\n\n\n==== Computer graphics and visualization ====\n\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data.",
      "The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including computer vision, image processing, and computational geometry, and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games.",
      "==== Human–computer interaction ====\n\nResearch that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.",
      "==== Scientific computing ====\nScientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems.",
      "In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines.",
      "==== Artificial intelligence ====\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals.",
      "From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence.",
      "AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding.",
      "The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question \"Can computers think?",
      "\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the Turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence.",
      "But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.",
      "=== Software engineering ===\n\nSoftware engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build.",
      "It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software.",
      "Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.",
      "== Discoveries ==\nThe philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Insights of Computer Science:\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's, George Boole's, Alan Turing's, Claude Shannon's, and Samuel Morse's insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).",
      "Alan Turing's insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:\nmove left one location;\nmove right one location;\nread symbol at current location;\nprint 0 at current location;\nprint 1 at current location.",
      "Corrado Böhm and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do \"anything\".Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\nsequence: first do this, then do that;\n selection: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;\nrepetition: WHILE such-and-such is the case DO this.",
      "Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming).",
      "== Programming paradigms ==\n\nProgramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways.",
      "Common programming paradigms include:\n\nFunctional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.",
      "It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.Imperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.",
      "In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.",
      "Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.Object-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.",
      "A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.",
      "Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.Many languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.",
      "== Academia ==\n\nConferences are important events for computer science research.",
      "During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet.",
      "Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications.",
      "One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.",
      "== Education ==\nComputer Science, known by its near synonyms, Computing, Computer Studies, Information Technology (IT) and Information and Computing Technology (ICT), has been taught in UK schools since the days of batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students.",
      "In 1981, the BBC produced a micro-computer and classroom network and Computer Studies became common for GCE O level students (11–16-year-old), and Computer Science to A level students.",
      "Its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the National Curriculum, for Key Stage 3 & 4.",
      "In September 2014 it became an entitlement for all 7,000,000 pupils over the age of 4.In the US, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured.",
      "According to a 2010 report by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) produces over 30% of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 peer-reviewed journals.",
      "Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula, and several others are following.",
      "=== Challenges ===\nIn many countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education.",
      "In 2012, only 20 percent of computer science degrees in the United States were awarded to women.",
      "The gender gap is also a problem in other western countries.",
      "The gap is smaller, or nonexistent, in some parts of the world.",
      "In 2011, women earned half of the computer science degrees in Malaysia.",

      "Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.",
      "From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.",
      "Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action.",
      "This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images.",
      "The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner.",
      "As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.",
      "Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, and image restoration.",
      "== Definition ==\nComputer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.",
      "From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.",
      "\"Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images.",
      "It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.\"",
      "As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images.",
      "The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner.",
      "As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.",
      "== History ==\nIn the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence.",
      "It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior.",
      "In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it \"describe what it saw\".What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract three-dimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding.",
      "Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision.",
      "These include the concept of scale-space, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes.",
      "Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields.",
      "By the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others.",
      "Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration.",
      "With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry.",
      "This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images.",
      "Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques.",
      "At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation.",
      "This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface).",
      "Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision.",
      "This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks.",
      "== Related fields ==\n\n\n=== Artificial intelligence ===\nAreas of artificial intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to navigate through an environment.",
      "A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them.",
      "Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.",
      "Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as pattern recognition and learning techniques.",
      "Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.",
      "=== Information engineering ===\nComputer vision is often considered to be part of information engineering.",
      "=== Solid-state physics ===\nSolid-state physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision.",
      "Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infra-red light.",
      "The sensors are designed using quantum physics.",
      "The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics.",
      "Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems.",
      "Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process.",
      "Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.",
      "=== Neurobiology ===\nA third field which plays an important role is neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system.",
      "Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals.",
      "This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how \"real\" vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision-related tasks.",
      "These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity.",
      "Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (e.g.",
      "neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in biology.",
      "Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision – indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information.",
      "The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals.",
      "Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems.",
      "Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.",
      "=== Signal processing ===\nYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing.",
      "Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision.",
      "However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in processing of one-variable signals.",
      "Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.",
      "=== Other fields ===\nBeside the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view.",
      "For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry.",
      "Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance.",
      "Computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industry.",
      "=== Distinctions ===\nThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision.",
      "There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover.",
      "This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names.",
      "On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.",
      "Computer graphics produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data.",
      "There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.",
      "The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:\n\nImage processing and image analysis tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image.",
      "This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.",
      "Computer vision includes 3D analysis from 2D images.",
      "This analyzes the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images.",
      "Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.",
      "Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies & methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications.",
      "Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., vision-based robots and systems for vision-based inspection, measurement, or picking (such as bin picking).",
      "This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software.",
      "It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.",
      "There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images.",
      "For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.",
      "Finally, pattern recognition is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks.",
      "A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.",
      "== Applications ==\nApplications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them.",
      "The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap.",
      "Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields.",
      "Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications.",
      "In many computer-vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.",
      "Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:\n\nAutomatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applications;\nAssisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification system;\nControlling processes, e.g., an industrial robot;\nDetecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting;\nInteraction, e.g., as the input to a device for computer-human interaction;\nModeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modeling;\nNavigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robot; and\nOrganizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.",
      "One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient.",
      "An example of this is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc.",
      "are another example.",
      "It also supports medical research by providing new information: e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments.",
      "Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or X-ray images for example—to reduce the influence of noise.",
      "A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process.",
      "One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects.",
      "Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm.",
      "Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.Military applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision.",
      "The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance.",
      "More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data.",
      "Modern military concepts, such as \"battlefield awareness\", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions.",
      "In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.",
      "One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).",
      "The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer-vision-based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations.",
      "Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g.",
      "for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment (SLAM) and for detecting obstacles.",
      "It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires.",
      "Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft.",
      "Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market.",
      "There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance.",
      "Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Mars Exploration Rover and ESA's ExoMars Rover.",
      "Other application areas include:\n\nSupport of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking (matchmoving).",
      "Surveillance.",
      "Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences\n\n\n== Typical tasks ==\nEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods.",
      "Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.",
      "Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.",
      "Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action.",
      "This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.",
      "=== Recognition ===\nThe classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.",
      "Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:\nObject recognition (also called object classification) – one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene.",
      "Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.",
      "Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized.",
      "Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.",
      "Detection – the image data are scanned for a specific condition.",
      "Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system.",
      "Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks.",
      "An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes.",
      "Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans.",
      "The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand.",
      "They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras).",
      "By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans.",
      "Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues.",
      "For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.",
      "Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:\n\nContent-based image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content.",
      "The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).",
      "Pose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera.",
      "An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.",
      "Optical character recognition (OCR) – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing (e.g.",
      "ASCII).",
      "2D code reading – reading of 2D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.",
      "Facial recognition\n Shape Recognition Technology (SRT) in people counter systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects\n\n\n=== Motion analysis ===\nSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images .",
      "Examples of such tasks are:\n\nEgomotion – determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.",
      "Tracking – following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (e.g., vehicles, humans or other organisms) in the image sequence.",
      "Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion.",
      "This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.",
      "=== Scene reconstruction ===\nGiven one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a 3D model of the scene.",
      "In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points.",
      "More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model.",
      "The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field.",
      "Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles.",
      "Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models .",
      "=== Image restoration ===\nThe aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.)",
      "from images.",
      "The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters.",
      "More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look, to distinguish them from noise.",
      "By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.",
      "An example in this field is inpainting.",
      "== System methods ==\nThe organization of a computer vision system is highly application-dependent.",
      "Some systems are stand-alone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc.",
      "The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation.",
      "Many functions are unique to the application.",
      "There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.",
      "Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc.",
      "Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence.",
      "The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.",
      "Pre-processing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method.",
      "Examples are:\nRe-sampling to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.",
      "Noise reduction to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.",
      "Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.",
      "Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.",
      "Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data.",
      "Typical examples of such features are:\nLines, edges and ridges.",
      "Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.Detection/segmentation – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing.",
      "Examples are:\nSelection of a specific set of interest points.",
      "Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.",
      "Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts (also referred to as spatial-taxon scene hierarchy), while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.",
      "Segmentation or co-segmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of per-frame foreground masks, while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.",
      "High-level processing – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object.",
      "The remaining processing deals with, for example:\nVerification that the data satisfy model-based and application-specific assumptions.",
      "Estimation of application-specific parameters, such as object pose or object size.",
      "Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.",
      "Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.",
      "Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for example:\nPass/fail on automatic inspection applications.",
      "Match/no-match in recognition applications.",
      "Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.",
      "=== Image-understanding systems ===\nImage-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events.",
      "Many of these requirements are really topics for further research.",
      "The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.",
      "While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing.",
      "Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.",
      "== Hardware ==\nThere are many kinds of computer vision systems; however, all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (camera, ccd, etc.",
      "), a processor, and control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism.",
      "In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system.",
      "Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment.",
      "Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories such as camera supports, cables and connectors.",
      "Most computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).",
      "A few computer vision systems use image-acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both, such as structured-light 3D scanners, thermographic cameras, hyperspectral imagers, radar imaging, lidar scanners, magnetic resonance images, side-scan sonar, synthetic aperture sonar, etc.",
      "Such hardware captures \"images\" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.",
      "While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second.",
      "For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms.",
      "When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realised.Egocentric vision systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective.",
      "As of 2016, vision processing units are emerging as a new class of processor, to complement CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) in this role.",

      "Cornell University ( kor-NEL) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca, New York.",
      "Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied.",
      "These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's founding principle, a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.",
      "\"The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy.",
      "The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar, and Cornell Tech, a graduate program that incorporates technology, business, and creative thinking.",
      "The program moved from Google's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017.",
      "Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York.",

      "The student body consists of more than 14,000 undergraduate and 8,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 116 countries.",
      "== History ==\n\nCornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS) Senate authorized the university as the state's land grant institution.",
      "Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment.",

      "The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.",
      "Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus and to outreach efforts.",
      "For example, in 1883 it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered dynamo to light the grounds.",
      "Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements; it has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by state and federal matching programs.Cornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes.",
      "It was one of the first universities to include alumni-elected representatives on its Board of Trustees.",
      "Cornell was also among the Ivies that had heightened student activism during the 1960s related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War; with protests and occupations resulting in the resignation of Cornell's president and the restructuring of university governance.",
      "Today the university has more than 4,000 courses.",

      "The student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural styles favored modernism.",
      "While some buildings are neatly arranged into quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly.",
      "These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus.",

      "In 2009, a new gas-fired combined heat and power facility replaced a coal-fired steam plant, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions to 7% below 1990 levels, and projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75,000 tons per year.",
      "This facility satisfies 15% of campus electrical needs, and a university-run, on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall Creek Gorge provides an additional 2%.",

      "Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.",
      "Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts.",
      "Deep learning models are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems yet have various differences from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially human brains), which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences.",
      "== Definition ==\nDeep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that:\nuse a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation.",
      "Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input.",
      "learn in supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manners.",
      "learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts.",
      "== Overview ==\nMost modern deep learning models are based on an artificial neural network, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation.",
      "In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.",
      "Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own.",
      "(Of course, this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.",
      ")The \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed.",
      "More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth.",
      "The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output.",
      "CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output.",
      "For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized).",
      "For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.",
      "No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth > 2.",
      "CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.",
      "Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network.",
      "Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning features.",
      "Deep learning architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method.",
      "Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.For supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods obviate feature engineering, by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components, and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation.",
      "Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks.",
      "This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data.",
      "Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are neural history compressors and deep belief networks.",
      "== Interpretations ==\nDeep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions.",
      "In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow.",
      "Lu et al.",
      "proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then deep neural network is not a universal approximator.",
      "The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning.",
      "It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively.",
      "More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function.",
      "The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks.",
      "The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.",
      "== History ==\nThe term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965.",
      "A 1971 paper described a deep network with 8 layers trained by the group method of data handling algorithm.Other deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.",
      "In 1989, Yann LeCun et al.",
      "applied the standard backpropagation algorithm, which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970, to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail.",
      "While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days.By 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, while recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model.",
      "Weng et al.",
      "suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron, a method for performing 3-D object recognition in cluttered scenes.",
      "Because it directly used natural images, Cresceptron started the beginning of general-purpose visual learning for natural 3D worlds.",
      "Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron.",
      "But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron learned an open number of features in each layer without supervision, where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel.",
      "Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network.",
      "Max pooling, now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g.",
      "ImageNet tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization.",
      "In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained.",
      "Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton.",
      "Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter.Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural network's (ANN) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.",
      "Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years.",
      "These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.",
      "Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.",
      "Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.",
      "Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling.",
      "An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s.",
      "Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition.",
      "Heck's speaker recognition team achieved the first significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation.",
      "While SRI experienced success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition.",
      "The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms.",
      "The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997.",
      "LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech.",
      "In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.",
      "Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs.",
      "In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation.",
      "The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets.",
      "Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
      "Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved.",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were superseded for ASR by CTC for LSTM.",
      "but are more successful in computer vision.",
      "The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun.",
      "Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.",
      "The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical.",
      "It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets.",
      "However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.",
      "The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.",
      "Analysis around 2009-2010, contrasted the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition, eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry.",
      "That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.Advances in hardware enabled the renewed interest.",
      "In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).” That year, Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create capable DNNs.",
      "While there, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.",
      "In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector math involved in machine learning.",
      "GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days.",
      "Specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing.",
      "=== Deep learning revolution ===\nIn 2012, a team led by Dahl won the \"Merck Molecular Activity Challenge\" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug.",
      "In 2014, Hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs and won the \"Tox21 Data Challenge\" of NIH, FDA and NCATS.Significant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012.",
      "Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, fast implementations of CNNs with max-pooling on GPUs in the style of Ciresan and colleagues were needed to progress on computer vision.",
      "In 2011, this approach achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest.",
      "Also in 2011, it won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest.",
      "Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al.",
      "at the leading conference CVPR showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records.",
      "In October 2012, a similar system by Krizhevsky et al.",
      "won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods.",
      "In November 2012, Ciresan et al.",
      "'s system also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic.",
      "In 2013 and 2014, the error rate on the ImageNet task using deep learning was further reduced, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition.",
      "The Wolfram Image Identification project publicized these improvements.Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.Some researchers assess that the October 2012 ImageNet victory anchored the start of a \"deep learning revolution\" that has transformed the AI industry.In March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.",
      "== Neural networks ==\n\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",
      "Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.",
      "For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images.",
      "They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.",
      "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain).",
      "Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron.",
      "The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it.",
      "Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1.",
      "Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.",
      "Typically, neurons are organized in layers.",
      "Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.",
      "Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",
      "The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.",
      "Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.",
      "Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.",
      "As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections.",
      "Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, playing \"Go\" ).",
      "=== Deep neural networks ===\nA deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.",
      "The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship.",
      "The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output.",
      "For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed.",
      "The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.)",
      "and return the proposed label.",
      "Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks.",
      "The goal is that eventually, the network will be trained to decompose an image into features, identify trends that exist across all samples and classify new images by their similarities without requiring human input.DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships.",
      "DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.",
      "The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches.",
      "Each architecture has found success in specific domains.",
      "It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.",
      "DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back.",
      "At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them.",
      "The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1.",
      "If the network didn’t accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.",
      "That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.",
      "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling.",
      "Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.Convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision.",
      "CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
      "==== Challenges ====\nAs with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs.",
      "Two common issues are overfitting and computation time.",
      "DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data.",
      "Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning or weight decay (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ℓ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}}\n  -regularization) or sparsity (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ℓ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}}\n  -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.",
      "Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training.",
      "This helps to exclude rare dependencies.",
      "Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights.",
      "Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources.",
      "Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) speed up computation.",
      "Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as, GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms.",
      "CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network.",
      "It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC.",
      "The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.",
      "== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Automatic speech recognition ===\n\nLarge-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning.",
      "LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT.",
      "The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences.",
      "Its small size lets many configurations be tried.",
      "More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models.",
      "This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed.",
      "The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.",
      "The debut of DNNs for speaker recognition in the late 1990s and speech recognition around 2009-2011 and of LSTM around 2003-2007, accelerated progress in eight major areas:\nScale-up/out and acclerated DNN training and decoding\nSequence discriminative training\nFeature processing by deep models with solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms\nAdaptation of DNNs and related deep models\nMulti-task and transfer learning by DNNs and related deep models\nCNNs and how to design them to best exploit domain knowledge of speech\nRNN and its rich LSTM variants\nOther types of deep models including tensor-based models and integrated deep generative/discriminative models.All major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft Cortana, Xbox, Skype Translator, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Apple Siri, Baidu and iFlyTek voice search, and a range of Nuance speech products, etc.)",
      "are based on deep learning.",
      "=== Image recognition ===\n\nA common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set.",
      "MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.",
      "As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations.",
      "A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.Deep learning-based image recognition has become \"superhuman\", producing more accurate results than human contestants.",
      "This first occurred in 2011.Deep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views.",
      "Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes.",
      "=== Visual art processing ===\nClosely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks.",
      "DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of a) identifying the style period of a given painting, b) Neural Style Transfer - capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video, and c) generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.",
      "=== Natural language processing ===\n\nNeural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s.",
      "LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding.",
      "Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space.",
      "Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar.",
      "A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.",
      "Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing.",
      "Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, Text classification and others.Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.",
      "Google Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory network.",
      "Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples.\"",
      "It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces.",
      "Google Translate supports over one hundred languages.",
      "The network encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\".",
      "GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.",
      "=== Drug discovery and toxicology ===\n\nA large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval.",
      "These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxic effects.",
      "Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets, off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.AtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design.",
      "AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.",
      "=== Customer relationship management ===\n\nDeep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables.",
      "The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value.",
      "=== Recommendation systems ===\n\nRecommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music recommendations.",
      "Multiview deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains.",
      "The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.",
      "=== Bioinformatics ===\n\nAn autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships.In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data.",
      "Deep learning has also showed efficacy in healthcare.",
      "=== Mobile advertising ===\nFinding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and assimilated before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server.",
      "Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets.",
      "Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle.",
      "This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.",
      "=== Image restoration ===\nDeep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and film colorization.",
      "These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, which trains on the image that needs restoration.",
      "=== Financial fraud detection ===\nDeep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection and anti-money laundering.",
      "\"Deep anti-money laundering detection system can spot and recognize relationships and similarities between data and, further down the road, learn to detect anomalies or classify and predict specific events\".",
      "The solution leverages both supervised learning techniques, such as the classification of suspicious transactions, and unsupervised learning, e.g.",
      "anomaly detection.",
      "=== Military ===\nThe United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation.",
      "== Relation to human cognitive and brain development ==\nDeep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s.",
      "These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems.",
      "These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models.",
      "Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers.",
      "This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment.",
      "A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature.",
      "\"A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective.",
      "On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism.",
      "Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality.",
      "In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported.",
      "For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations.",
      "Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single-unit and at the population levels.",
      "== Commercial activity ==\nMany organizations employ deep learning for particular applications.",
      "Facebook's AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them.Google's DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input.",
      "In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player.",
      "Google Translate uses an LSTM to translate between more than 100 languages.",
      "In 2015, Blippar demonstrated a mobile augmented reality application that uses deep learning to recognize objects in real time.As of 2008, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor.First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and UT researchers.",
      "Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation.Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person.",
      "The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as “good job” and “bad job.”\n\n\n== Criticism and comment ==\nDeep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computer science.",
      "=== Theory ===\n\nA main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.",
      "Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent.",
      "However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear.",
      "(e.g., Does it converge?",
      "If so, how fast?",
      "What is it approximating?)",
      "Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.",
      "Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution.",
      "Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely.",
      "Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted:\"Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines.",
      "Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used.",
      "The most powerful A.I.",
      "systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.",
      "\"As an alternative to this emphasis on the limits of deep learning, one author speculated that it might be possible to train a machine vision stack to perform the sophisticated task of discriminating between \"old master\" and amateur figure drawings, and hypothesized that such a sensitivity might represent the rudiments of a non-trivial machine empathy.",
      "This same author proposed that this would be in line with anthropology, which identifies a concern with aesthetics as a key element of behavioral modernity.In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might inhere within relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian's web site.",
      "=== Errors ===\nSome deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images.",
      "Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI) architectures.",
      "These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events.",
      "Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "=== Cyberthreat ===\nAs deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience shows that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.",
      "By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize.",
      "For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target.",
      "Such a manipulation is termed an “adversarial attack.” In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it.",
      "The modified images looked no different to human eyes.",
      "Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system.",
      "One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it.",
      "A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another.",
      "In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry.",
      "ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.Another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address that would download malware.In “data poisoning”, false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system’s training set to prevent it from achieving mastery.",

      "DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence company founded in September 2010, currently owned by Alphabet Inc.",
      "The company is based in London, with research centres in Canada, France, and the United States.",
      "Acquired by Google in 2014, the company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing machine, or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine, resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain.The company made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, the world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film.A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning.",
      "== History ==\nThe start-up was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in 2010.",
      "Hassabis and Legg first met at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit.During one of the interviews, Demis Hassabis said that the start-up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties, which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today.",
      "Some of those games included Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders.",
      "AI was introduced to one game at a time, without any prior knowledge of its rules.",
      "After spending some time on learning the game, AI would eventually become an expert in it.",
      "“The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it.” The goal of the founders is to create a general-purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything.",
      "Major venture capital firms Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company, as well as entrepreneurs Scott Banister and Elon Musk.",
      "Jaan Tallinn was an early investor and an adviser to the company.",
      "On 26 January 2014, Google announced the company had acquired DeepMind for $500 million, and that it had agreed to take over DeepMind Technologies.",
      "The sale to Google took place after Facebook reportedly ended negotiations with DeepMind Technologies in 2013.",
      "The company was afterwards renamed Google DeepMind and kept that name for about two years.In 2014, DeepMind received the \"Company of the Year\" award from Cambridge Computer Laboratory.In September 2015, DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial Information Sharing Agreement (ISA) to co-develop a clinical task management app, Streams.After Google's acquisition the company established an artificial intelligence ethics board.",
      "The ethics board for AI research remains a mystery, with both Google and DeepMind declining to reveal who sits on the board.",
      "DeepMind, together with Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft, is a founding member of Partnership on AI, an organization devoted to the society-AI interface.",
      "DeepMind has opened a new unit called DeepMind Ethics and Society and focused on the ethical and societal questions raised by artificial intelligence featuring prominent philosopher Nick Bostrom as advisor.",
      "In October 2017, DeepMind launched a new research team to investigate AI ethics.",
      "== Machine learning ==\nDeepMind Technologies' goal is to \"solve intelligence\", which they are trying to achieve by combining \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms\".",
      "They are trying to formalize intelligence in order to not only implement it into machines, but also understand the human brain, as Demis Hassabis explains:\n\n[...] attempting to distil intelligence into an algorithmic construct may prove to be the best path to understanding some of the enduring mysteries of our minds.",
      "Google Research has released a paper in 2016 regarding AI Safety and avoiding undesirable behaviour during the AI learning process.",
      "Deepmind has also released several publications via its website.",
      "In 2017 DeepMind released GridWorld, an open-source testbed for evaluating whether an algorithm learns to disable its kill switch or otherwise exhibits certain undesirable behaviours.To date, the company has published research on computer systems that are able to play games, and developing these systems, ranging from strategy games such as Go to arcade games.",
      "According to Shane Legg, human-level machine intelligence can be achieved \"when a machine can learn to play a really wide range of games from perceptual stream input and output, and transfer understanding across games[...].",
      "\"Research describing an AI playing seven different Atari 2600 video games (the Pong game in Video Olympics, Breakout, Space Invaders, Seaquest, Beamrider, Enduro, and Q*bert) reportedly led to the company's acquisition by Google.",
      "Hassabis has mentioned the popular e-sport game StarCraft as a possible future challenge, since it requires a high level of strategic thinking and handling imperfect information.",
      "The first demonstration of the DeepMind progress in StarCraft II occurred on January 24, 2019 on StarCrafts Twitch channel and DeepMind’s YouTube channel.In July 2018, researchers from DeepMind trained one of its systems to play the famous computer game Quake III Arena.",
      "=== Deep reinforcement learning ===\nAs opposed to other AIs, such as IBM's Deep Blue or Watson, which were developed for a pre-defined purpose and only function within its scope, DeepMind claims that its system is not pre-programmed: it learns from experience, using only raw pixels as data input.",
      "Technically it uses deep learning on a convolutional neural network, with a novel form of Q-learning, a form of model-free reinforcement learning.",
      "They test the system on video games, notably early arcade games, such as Space Invaders or Breakout.",
      "Without altering the code, the AI begins to understand how to play the game, and after some time plays, for a few games (most notably Breakout), a more efficient game than any human ever could.As of 2014, DeepMind played below the current World Record for most games, for example Space Invaders, Ms Pac-Man and Q*Bert.",
      "DeepMind's AI had been applied to video games made in the 1970s and 1980s; work was ongoing for more complex 3D games such as Doom, which first appeared in the early 1990s.",
      "=== AlphaGo and successors ===\n\nIn October 2015, a computer Go program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the European Go champion Fan Hui, a 2 dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero.",
      "This is the first time an artificial intelligence (AI) defeated a professional Go player.",
      "Previously, computers were only known to have played Go at \"amateur\" level.",
      "Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like chess, due to the much larger number of possibilities, making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as brute-force.In March 2016 it beat Lee Sedol—a 9th dan Go player and one of the highest ranked players in the world—with a score of 4-1 in a five-game match.",
      "In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No.",
      "1 ranking for two years.",
      "It used a supervised learning protocol, studying large numbers of games played by humans against each other.In 2017, an improved version, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo 100 games to 0.",
      "AlphaGo Zero's strategies were self-taught.",
      "AlphaGo Zero was able to beat its predecessor after just three days with less processing power than AlphaGo; in comparison, the original AlphaGo needed months to learn how to play.Later that year, AlphaZero, a modified version of AlphaGo Zero, gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi.",
      "Like AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero learned solely through self-play.",
      "==== Technology ====\nAlphaGo technology was developed based on the deep reinforcement learning approach.",
      "This makes AlphaGo different from the rest of AI technologies on the market.",
      "With that said, AlphaGo's ‘brain’ was introduced to various moves based on the historical tournament data.",
      "The number of moves was increased gradually until it eventually processed over 30 million of them.",
      "The aim was to have the system mimic the human player and eventually become better.",
      "It played against itself and learned not only from its own defeats but wins as well; thus, it learned to improve itself over the time and increased its winning rate as a result.AlphaGo used two deep neural networks: a policy network to evaluate move probabilities and a value network to assess positions.",
      "The policy network trained via supervised learning, and was subsequently refined by policy-gradient reinforcement learning.",
      "The value network learned to predict winners of games played by the policy network against itself.",
      "After training these networks employed a lookahead Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), using the policy network to identify candidate high-probability moves, while the value network (in conjunction with Monte Carlo rollouts using a fast rollout policy) evaluated tree positions.Zero trained using reinforcement learning in which the system played millions of games against itself.",
      "Its only guide was to increase its win rate.",
      "It did so without learning from games played by humans.",
      "Its only input features are the black and white stones from the board.",
      "It uses a single neural network, rather than separate policy and value networks.",
      "Its simplified tree search relies upon this neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves, without Monte Carlo rollouts.",
      "A new reinforcement learning algorithm incorporates lookahead search inside the training loop.",
      "AlphaGo Zero employed around 15 people and millions in computing resources.",
      "Ultimately, it needed much less computing power than AlphaGo, running on four specialized AI processors (Google TPUs), instead of AlphaGo's 48.",
      "=== AlphaFold ===\nIn 2016 DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein folding, one of the toughest problems in science.",
      "In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.",
      "“This is a lighthouse project, our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental, very important, real-world scientific problem,” Demis Hassabis said to The Guardian.",
      "This demonstration to the power of AI, specifically DeepMind's application, bodes well to understanding the causes and cures to diseases and serves as a component to potential Nobel-prize worth breakthroughs in the next decade.",
      "=== AlphaStar ===\nIn January 2019, DeepMind introduced AlphaStar, a program playing the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.",
      "AlphaStar uses a reinforced learning to learn the basics based on replays from human players, and later played against itself to enhance its skills.",
      "At the time of the presentation, AlphaStar had knowledge equivalent to 200 years of playing time; it won 10 consecutive matches against professional players, and lost just one.",
      "=== WaveNet ===\n\nWaveNet is DeepMind's deep generative model of raw audio waveforms.",
      "WaveNet was originally too computationally intensive for use in consumer products when it debuted in 2016; however, in late 2017, it became ready for use in consumer applications such as Google Assistant.",
      "In 2018 Google launched a commercial a text-to-speech product, Cloud Text-to-Speech, based on WaveNet.",
      "=== Miscellaneous contributions to Google ===\nGoogle has stated that DeepMind algorithms have greatly increased the efficiency of cooling its data centers.",
      "In addition, DeepMind (alongside other Alphabet AI researchers) assists Google Play's personalized app recommendations.",
      "DeepMind has also collaborated with the Android team at Google for the creation of two new features which will be available to people with devices running Android Pie, the ninth installment of Google's mobile operating system.",
      "These features, Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Brightness, use machine learning to conserve energy and make devices running the operating system easier to use.",
      "It is the first time DeepMind has used these techniques on such a small scale, with typical machine learning applications requiring orders of magnitude more compute power.",
      "== DeepMind Health ==\nIn July 2016, a collaboration between DeepMind and Moorfields Eye Hospital was announced to develop AI applications for healthcare.",
      "DeepMind would be applied to the analysis of anonymised eye scans, searching for early signs of diseases leading to blindness.",
      "In August 2016, a research programme with University College London Hospital was announced with the aim of developing an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues in head and neck areas.There are also projects with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records.",
      "Staff at the Royal Free Hospital were reported as saying in December 2017 that access to patient data through the app had saved a ‘huge amount of time’ and made a ‘phenomenal’ difference to the management of patients with acute kidney injury.",
      "Test result data is sent to staff's mobile phones and alerts them to change in the patient's condition.",
      "It also enables staff to see if someone else has responded, and to show patients their results in visual form.In November 2017, DeepMind announced a research partnership with the Cancer Research UK Centre at Imperial College London with the goal of improving breast cancer detection by applying machine learning to mammography.",
      "Additionally, in February 2018, DeepMind announced it was working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in an attempt to use machine learning to predict the onset of acute kidney injury in patients, and also more broadly the general deterioration of patients during a hospital stay so that doctors and nurses can more quickly treat patients in need.DeepMind developed an app called Streams, which sends alerts to doctors about patients at risk of acute risk injury.",
      "On 13 November 2018, DeepMind announced that its health division and the Streams app would be absorbed into Google Health.",
      "Privacy advocates said the announcement betrayed patient trust and appeared to contradict previous statements by DeepMind that patient data would not be connected to Google accounts or services.",
      "A spokesman for DeepMind said that patient data would still be kept separate from Google services or projects.",
      "=== NHS data-sharing controversy ===\nIn April 2016, New Scientist obtained a copy of a data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust.",
      "The latter operates three London hospitals where an estimated 1.6 million patients are treated annually.",
      "The agreement shows DeepMind Health had access to admissions, discharge and transfer data, accident and emergency, pathology and radiology, and critical care at these hospitals.",
      "This included personal details such as whether patients had been diagnosed with HIV, suffered from depression or had ever undergone an abortion in order to conduct research to seek better outcomes in various health conditions.A complaint was filed to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), arguing that the data should be pseudonymised and encrypted.",
      "In May 2016, New Scientist published a further article claiming that the project had failed to secure approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.In May 2017, Sky News published a leaked letter from the National Data Guardian, Dame Fiona Caldicott, revealing that in her \"considered opinion\" the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free took place on an \"inappropriate legal basis\".",

      "With the former Google UK and EU policy manager Verity Harding co-leading this new team with Sean Legassick, their goal is to fund external research of the following themes: privacy transparency and fairness; economic impacts; governance and accountability; managing AI risk; AI morality and values; and how AI can address the world's challenges.",
      "As a result, the team hopes to further understand the ethical implications of AI and aid society to seeing AI can be beneficial.This new subdivision of DeepMind is a completely separate unit from the partnership of leading companies using AI, academia, civil society organizations and nonprofits of the name Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society which DeepMind is also a part of.",

      "Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems.",
      "A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.",
      "The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal.",
      "Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.",
      "Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.",
      "A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs).",
      "There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems.",
      "In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate with each other via message passing.",
      "== Introduction ==\nThe word parallel in terms such as \"parallel system\", \"distributed programming\", and \"distributed algorithm\" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area.",
      "The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.While there is no single definition of a distributed system, the following defining properties are commonly used as:\n\nThere are several autonomous computational entities (computers or nodes), each of which has its own local memory.",
      "The entities communicate with each other by message passing.A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational problem; the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit.",
      "Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.Other typical properties of distributed systems include the following:\n\nThe system has to tolerate failures in individual computers.",
      "The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers) is not known in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computers and network links, and the system may change during the execution of a distributed program.",
      "Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system.",
      "Each computer may know only one part of the input.",
      "== Parallel and distributed computing ==\n\nDistributed systems are groups of networked computers, which have the same goal for their work.",
      "The terms \"concurrent computing\", \"parallel computing\", and \"distributed computing\" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.",
      "The same system may be characterized both as \"parallel\" and \"distributed\"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.",
      "Parallel computing may be seen as a particular tightly coupled form of distributed computing, and distributed computing may be seen as a loosely coupled form of parallel computing.",
      "Nevertheless, it is possible to roughly classify concurrent systems as \"parallel\" or \"distributed\" using the following criteria:\n\nIn parallel computing, all processors may have access to a shared memory to exchange information between processors.",
      "In distributed computing, each processor has its own private memory (distributed memory).",
      "Information is exchanged by passing messages between the processors.The figure on the right illustrates the difference between distributed and parallel systems.",
      "Figure (a) is a schematic view of a typical distributed system; the system is represented as a network topology in which each node is a computer and each line connecting the nodes is a communication link.",
      "Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links.",
      "Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.",
      "The situation is further complicated by the traditional uses of the terms parallel and distributed algorithm that do not quite match the above definitions of parallel and distributed systems (see below for more detailed discussion).",
      "Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, high-performance parallel computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses parallel algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.",
      "== History ==\nThe use of concurrent processes that communicate by message-passing has its roots in operating system architectures studied in the 1960s.",
      "The first widespread distributed systems were local-area networks such as Ethernet, which was invented in the 1970s.ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, was introduced in the late 1960s, and ARPANET e-mail was invented in the early 1970s.",
      "E-mail became the most successful application of ARPANET, and it is probably the earliest example of a large-scale distributed application.",
      "In addition to ARPANET, and its successor, the Internet, other early worldwide computer networks included Usenet and FidoNet from the 1980s, both of which were used to support distributed discussion systems.The study of distributed computing became its own branch of computer science in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",
      "The first conference in the field, Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), dates back to 1982, and its counterpart International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC) was first held in Ottawa in 1985 as the International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs.",
      "== Architectures ==\nVarious hardware and software architectures are used for distributed computing.",
      "At a lower level, it is necessary to interconnect multiple CPUs with some sort of network, regardless of whether that network is printed onto a circuit board or made up of loosely coupled devices and cables.",
      "At a higher level, it is necessary to interconnect processes running on those CPUs with some sort of communication system.Distributed programming typically falls into one of several basic architectures: client–server, three-tier, n-tier, or peer-to-peer; or categories: loose coupling, or tight coupling.",
      "Client–server: architectures where smart clients contact the server for data then format and display it to the users.",
      "Input at the client is committed back to the server when it represents a permanent change.",
      "Three-tier: architectures that move the client intelligence to a middle tier so that stateless clients can be used.",
      "This simplifies application deployment.",
      "Most web applications are three-tier.",
      "n-tier: architectures that refer typically to web applications which further forward their requests to other enterprise services.",
      "This type of application is the one most responsible for the success of application servers.",
      "Peer-to-peer: architectures where there are no special machines that provide a service or manage the network resources.",
      "Instead all responsibilities are uniformly divided among all machines, known as peers.",
      "Peers can serve both as clients and as servers.Another basic aspect of distributed computing architecture is the method of communicating and coordinating work among concurrent processes.",
      "Through various message passing protocols, processes may communicate directly with one another, typically in a master/slave relationship.",
      "Alternatively, a \"database-centric\" architecture can enable distributed computing to be done without any form of direct inter-process communication, by utilizing a shared database.",
      "== Applications ==\nReasons for using distributed systems and distributed computing may include:\n\nThe very nature of an application may require the use of a communication network that connects several computers: for example, data produced in one physical location and required in another location.",
      "There are many cases in which the use of a single computer would be possible in principle, but the use of a distributed system is beneficial for practical reasons.",
      "For example, it may be more cost-efficient to obtain the desired level of performance by using a cluster of several low-end computers, in comparison with a single high-end computer.",
      "A distributed system can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no single point of failure.",
      "Moreover, a distributed system may be easier to expand and manage than a monolithic uniprocessor system.",
      "== Examples ==\nExamples of distributed systems and applications of distributed computing include the following:\ntelecommunication networks:\ntelephone networks and cellular networks,\ncomputer networks such as the Internet,\nwireless sensor networks,\nrouting algorithms;\nnetwork applications:\nWorld Wide Web and peer-to-peer networks,\nmassively multiplayer online games and virtual reality communities,\ndistributed databases and distributed database management systems,\nnetwork file systems,\ndistributed information processing systems such as banking systems and airline reservation systems;\nreal-time process control:\naircraft control systems,\nindustrial control systems;\nparallel computation:\nscientific computing, including cluster computing and grid computing and various volunteer computing projects (see the list of distributed computing projects),\ndistributed rendering in computer graphics\n\n\n== Theoretical foundations ==\n\n\n=== Models ===\nMany tasks that we would like to automate by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer.",
      "In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems.",
      "Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance.",
      "Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.",
      "Theoretical computer science seeks to understand which computational problems can be solved by using a computer (computability theory) and how efficiently (computational complexity theory).",
      "Traditionally, it is said that a problem can be solved by using a computer if we can design an algorithm that produces a correct solution for any given instance.",
      "Such an algorithm can be implemented as a computer program that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from input, performs some computation, and produces the solution as output.",
      "Formalisms such as random access machines or universal Turing machines can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.The field of concurrent and distributed computing studies similar questions in the case of either multiple computers, or a computer that executes a network of interacting processes: which computational problems can be solved in such a network and how efficiently?",
      "However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by \"solving a problem\" in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?The discussion below focuses on the case of multiple computers, although many of the issues are the same for concurrent processes running on a single computer.",
      "Three viewpoints are commonly used:\n\nParallel algorithms in shared-memory modelAll processors have access to a shared memory.",
      "The algorithm designer chooses the program executed by each processor.",
      "One theoretical model is the parallel random access machines (PRAM) that are used.",
      "However, the classical PRAM model assumes synchronous access to the shared memory.",
      "Shared-memory programs can be extended to distributed systems if the underlying operating system encapsulates the communication between nodes and virtually unifies the memory across all individual systems.",
      "A model that is closer to the behavior of real-world multiprocessor machines and takes into account the use of machine instructions, such as Compare-and-swap (CAS), is that of asynchronous shared memory.",
      "There is a wide body of work on this model, a summary of which can be found in the literature.Parallel algorithms in message-passing modelThe algorithm designer chooses the structure of the network, as well as the program executed by each computer.",
      "Models such as Boolean circuits and sorting networks are used.",
      "A Boolean circuit can be seen as a computer network: each gate is a computer that runs an extremely simple computer program.",
      "Similarly, a sorting network can be seen as a computer network: each comparator is a computer.Distributed algorithms in message-passing modelThe algorithm designer only chooses the computer program.",
      "All computers run the same program.",
      "The system must work correctly regardless of the structure of the network.",
      "A commonly used model is a graph with one finite-state machine per node.In the case of distributed algorithms, computational problems are typically related to graphs.",
      "Often the graph that describes the structure of the computer network is the problem instance.",
      "This is illustrated in the following example.",
      "=== An example ===\nConsider the computational problem of finding a coloring of a given graph G. Different fields might take the following approaches:\n\nCentralized algorithmsThe graph G is encoded as a string, and the string is given as input to a computer.",
      "The computer program finds a coloring of the graph, encodes the coloring as a string, and outputs the result.Parallel algorithmsAgain, the graph G is encoded as a string.",
      "However, multiple computers can access the same string in parallel.",
      "Each computer might focus on one part of the graph and produce a coloring for that part.",
      "The main focus is on high-performance computation that exploits the processing power of multiple computers in parallel.Distributed algorithmsThe graph G is the structure of the computer network.",
      "There is one computer for each node of G and one communication link for each edge of G. Initially, each computer only knows about its immediate neighbors in the graph G; the computers must exchange messages with each other to discover more about the structure of G. Each computer must produce its own color as output.",
      "The main focus is on coordinating the operation of an arbitrary distributed system.While the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is a lot of interaction between the two fields.",
      "For example, the Cole–Vishkin algorithm for graph coloring was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.",
      "Moreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing).",
      "The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).",
      "=== Complexity measures ===\nIn parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers.",
      "Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see speedup).",
      "If a decision problem can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class NC.",
      "The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits—PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.In the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps.",
      "Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion.",
      "This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model.",
      "During each communication round, all nodes in parallel (1) receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2) perform arbitrary local computation, and (3) send new messages to their neighbors.",
      "In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.This complexity measure is closely related to the diameter of the network.",
      "Let D be the diameter of the network.",
      "On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2D communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (D rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (D rounds).",
      "On the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than D communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network.",
      "In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their local D-neighbourhood.",
      "Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than D rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field.",
      "Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.",
      "Another commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf.",
      "communication complexity).",
      "The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which similarly defined as the LOCAL model but where single messages can only contain B bits.",
      "=== Other problems ===\nTraditional computational problems take the perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question for a while, and then produces an answer and stops.",
      "However, there are also problems where we do not want the system to ever stop.",
      "Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems.",
      "In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.",
      "There are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing.",
      "The first example is challenges that are related to fault-tolerance.",
      "Examples of related problems include consensus problems, Byzantine fault tolerance, and self-stabilisation.A lot of research is also focused on understanding the asynchronous nature of distributed systems:\n\nSynchronizers can be used to run synchronous algorithms in asynchronous systems.",
      "Logical clocks provide a causal happened-before ordering of events.",
      "Clock synchronization algorithms provide globally consistent physical time stamps.Election\nCoordinator election (or leader election) is the process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes).",
      "Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the \"coordinator\" (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator.",
      "After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.The network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the \"coordinator\" state.",
      "For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them.",
      "For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, and decide that the node with the highest identity is the coordinator.The definition of this problem is often attributed to LeLann, who formalized it as a method to create a new token in a token ring network in which the token has been lost.Coordinator election algorithms are designed to be economical in terms of total bytes transmitted, and time.",
      "The algorithm suggested by Gallager, Humblet, and Spira  for general undirected graphs has had a strong impact on the design of distributed algorithms in general, and won the Dijkstra Prize for an influential paper in distributed computing.",
      "Many other algorithms were suggested for different kind of network graphs, such as undirected rings, unidirectional rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others.",
      "A general method that decouples the issue of the graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.In order to perform coordination, distributed systems employ the concept of coordinators.",
      "The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator.",
      "Several central coordinator election algorithms exist.",
      "=== Properties of distributed systems ===\nSo far the focus has been on designing a distributed system that solves a given problem.",
      "A complementary research problem is studying the properties of a given distributed system.The halting problem is an analogous example from the field of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever.",
      "The halting problem is undecidable in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.However, there are many interesting special cases that are decidable.",
      "In particular, it is possible to reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines.",
      "One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock.",
      "This problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., it is decidable, but it is not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.",

      "Musk tweeted that Richard Stanton, leader of the international diving team, had earlier urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case the flooding worsened.Although the device could safely hold an occupant, there were concerns that its rigid body was only slightly smaller than the narrowest passages in the cave, making it risky to get it through the tighter turns.",
      "==== Media coverage and Musk's behavior ====\nAs media coverage of the event grew, some were skeptical of Musk's intentions, claiming the submarine was mainly built for publicity for Tesla and Musk, citing the apparent uselessness of the device.One of the divers said to have played a major role in the rescue criticized the submarine as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\"; and said that Musk \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\".",
      "Musk reasserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to the diver as \"pedo guy\" without offering any evidence to support the claim, causing backlash against Musk.",
      "He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device \"Stay tuned jackass\".",
      "On 16 July, the diver stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's comments.After Musk's Tweets, Tesla shares fell 4% as some investors worried about his erratic behavior.",

      "Two days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks: \"The fault is mine and mine alone\" and \"my words were spoken in anger\".On August 28, 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter regarding how Musk had handled the diver's criticism, Musk circled back to the pedophilia accusation tweeting \"You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?",
      "He was offered free legal services.",
      "...\".",
      "The following day, a letter from L. Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated August 6, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.On 5 September 2018, a reporter from Buzzfeed News published an email written by Musk on August 30 marked \"off the record\", saying \"I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.",
      "As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue ...",
      "I fucking hope he sues me.\"",
      "Musk confirmed that he had sent the email.",
      "The diver subsequently filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court in mid-September 2018, with plans to also file a similar case in the United Kingdom.",

      "==== Lobbying ====\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a \"significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats,\" but that he also gives heavily to Republicans.",
      "Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the United States government.A 2012 report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, SpaceX had spent more US$4 million on lobbying the United States Congress and more than US$800,000 in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans.",
      "The same report said that \"SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,\" and that \"unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day 1.\"",

      "Additionally, SpaceX hired former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to represent the company, via the Washington-based lobbying group Patton Boggs LLP.",
      "Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.Musk had been a supporter of the U.S. political action committee (PAC) FWD.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform.",
      "However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the Keystone Pipeline.",

      "If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.",
      "\"In December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website Mic called Musk a \"complete hypocrite,\" stating that \"[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee – both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as Rep. Michelle Bachman (R-Minn.).\"",
      "Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.",
      "==== Subsidies ====\nMusk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior.",
      "Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.Musk's statements have been widely criticized, with Stanford University Professor Fred Turner noting that \"if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state.",
      "It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received.",
      "And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\"",
      "Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness.",
      "And I think there is a business reason for it.",
      "They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\"",
      "Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\"",
      "While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for High Voltage, his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money – I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.",
      "\"In 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an LA Times article claimed that SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated US$4.9 billion in government subsidies over twenty years.",

      "=== Destiny and religion ===\nWhen asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics,\" Musk responded:\n\nWell, I do.",
      "Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff?",
      "I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\"",
      "So it sort of begs the question.",
      "So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics.",
      "You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.",
      "Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\" before an important Falcon 1 launch.",

      "=== Extraterrestrial life ===\nAlthough Musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely.",
      "Musk later said that he \"hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe,\" and stated that it is \"probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.",
      "\"Musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the Fermi paradox:\n\nThe absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there.",
      "If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a Petri dish ...",
      "If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way.",
      "... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.",
      "=== Artificial intelligence ===\nMusk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it \"the most serious threat to the survival of the human race.\"",
      "During a 2014 interview at the MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, \"I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.\"",
      "Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as \"summoning the demon\".Despite this, Musk has previously invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.",

      "Musk continued, \"There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator – there are some scary outcomes.",
      "And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.",
      "\"In June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered:\n\nThe strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong – two rectangles and a dot.",
      "That's where we were.",
      "Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year.",
      "And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality.",
      "If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.",
      "Musk's dark warnings over artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy.",
      "He and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings irresponsible.",
      "Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject.",
      "In 2014, Slate's Adam Elkus argued that current AIs were as intelligent as a toddlers, and only in certain fields, going on to say that Musk's \"summoning the demon\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to AI research budgets.The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity.",
      "Atkinson stated \"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\"",
      "Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: \"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ...",
      "If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\"",
      "In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless \"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\"",
      "=== Public transport ===\nAt a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in December 2017, Musk stated that:\n\nI think public transport is painful.",
      "It sucks.",
      "Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end?",
      "And it doesn't go all the time.",
      "It's a pain in the ass.",
      "That's why everyone doesn't like it.",
      "And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great.",
      "And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.",
      "Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.His comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts.",
      "Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.",

      "Musk responded with \"You're an idiot,\" later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot.'\"",

      "An embedded system is a controller programmed and controlled by a real-time operating system (RTOS) with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints.",
      "It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.",
      "Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.",
      "Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e.",
      "CPUs with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems.",
      "In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand.",
      "A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).",
      "Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance.",
      "Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.",
      "Embedded systems range from portable devices such as digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic lights, factory controllers, and largely complex systems like hybrid vehicles, MRI, and avionics.",
      "Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclosure.",
      "== History ==\nOne of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the Apollo Guidance Computer, developed ca.",
      "1965 by Charles Stark Draper at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory.",
      "At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed monolithic integrated circuits to reduce the size and weight.",
      "An early mass-produced embedded system was the Autonetics D-17 guidance computer for the Minuteman missile, released in 1961.",
      "When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.",
      "Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality.",
      "An early microprocessor for example , the Intel 4004 (released in 1971), was designed for calculators and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips.",
      "In 1978 National Engineering Manufacturers Association released a \"standard\" for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.",
      "As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based analog components such as potentiometers and variable capacitors with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products.",
      "By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a microcontroller.",
      "Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.",
      "A comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components.",
      "Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself.",
      "Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software.",
      "Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.",
      "== Applications ==\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications.",
      "Telecommunications systems employ numerous embedded systems from telephone switches for the network to cell phones at the end user.",
      "Computer networking uses dedicated routers and network bridges to route data.",
      "Consumer electronics include MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, GPS receivers, and printers.",
      "Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features.",
      "Advanced HVAC systems use networked thermostats to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and season.",
      "Home automation uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.",
      "Transportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.",
      "New airplanes contain advanced avionics such as inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.",
      "Various electric motors — brushless DC motors, induction motors and DC motors — use electric/electronic motor controllers.",
      "Automobiles, electric vehicles, and hybrid vehicles increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.",
      "Other automotive safety systems include anti-lock braking system (ABS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC/ESP), traction control (TCS) and automatic four-wheel drive.",
      "Medical equipment uses embedded systems for vital signs monitoring, electronic stethoscopes for amplifying sounds, and various medical imaging (PET, SPECT, CT, and MRI) for non-invasive internal inspections.",
      "Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.Embedded systems are used in transportation, fire safety, safety and security, medical applications and life critical systems, as these systems can be isolated from hacking and thus, be more reliable, unless connected to wired or wireless networks via on-chip 3G cellular or other methods for IoT monitoring and control purposes.",
      "For fire safety, the systems can be designed to have greater ability to handle higher temperatures and continue to operate.",
      "In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.",
      "A new class of miniature wireless devices called motes are networked wireless sensors.",
      "Wireless sensor networking, WSN, makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems.",
      "These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charged.",
      "Embedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.",
      "== Characteristics ==\nEmbedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks.",
      "Some also have real-time performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.",
      "Embedded systems are not always standalone devices.",
      "Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose.",
      "For example, the Gibson Robot Guitar features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.",
      "Similarly, an embedded system in an automobile provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.",
      "The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips.",
      "They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.",
      "=== User interface ===\n\nEmbedded systems range from no user interface at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex graphical user interfaces that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.",
      "Simple embedded devices use buttons, LEDs, graphic or character LCDs (HD44780 LCD for example) with a simple menu system.",
      "More sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with touch sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired.",
      "Handheld systems often have a screen with a \"joystick button\" for a pointing device.",
      "Some systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g.",
      "RS-232, USB, I²C, etc.)",
      "or network (e.g.",
      "Ethernet) connection.",
      "This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies BSP and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC.",
      "A good example of this is the combination of an embedded web server running on an embedded device (such as an IP camera) or a network router.",
      "The user interface is displayed in a web browser on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.",
      "=== Processors in embedded systems ===\nExamples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost.",
      "This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with.",
      "However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.",
      "For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.Embedded processors can be broken into two broad categories.",
      "Ordinary microprocessors (μP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals.",
      "Microcontrollers (μC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost.",
      "In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic CPU architectures are used since software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user.",
      "Both Von Neumann as well as various degrees of Harvard architectures are used.",
      "RISC as well as non-RISC processors are found.",
      "Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit.",
      "Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.",
      "Numerous microcontrollers have been developed for embedded systems use.",
      "General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.",
      "==== Ready-made computer boards ====\nPC/104 and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ready-made computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based.",
      "These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems.",
      "They often use DOS, Linux, NetBSD, or an embedded real-time operating system such as MicroC/OS-II, QNX or VxWorks.",
      "Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.",
      "In certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general purpose x86 personal computers.",
      "Boards such as the VIA EPIA range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers.",
      "The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development.",
      "Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role.",
      "Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are ATMs and arcade machines, which contain code specific to the application.",
      "However, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI buses.",
      "When a system-on-a-chip processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.",
      "One common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density BGA chips such as an ARM-based system-on-a-chip processor and peripherals, external flash memory for storage, and DRAM for runtime memory.",
      "The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including Linux and some real time choices.",
      "These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.",
      "Implementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms.",
      "These platforms include, but are not limited to, Arduino and Raspberry Pi.",
      "==== ASIC and FPGA solutions ====\nA common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the system on a chip (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip.",
      "SoCs can be implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).",
      "=== Peripherals ===\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world via peripherals, such as:\n\nSerial Communication Interfaces (SCI): RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, etc.",
      "Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: I2C, SPI, SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB)\nMulti Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)",
      "Networks: Ethernet, LonWorks, etc.",
      "Fieldbuses: CAN-Bus, LIN-Bus, PROFIBUS, etc.",
      "Timers: PLL(s), Capture/Compare and Time Processing Units\nDiscrete IO: aka General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)\nAnalog to Digital/Digital to Analog (ADC/DAC)\nDebugging: JTAG, ISP, BDM Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.",
      "=== Tools ===\nAs with other software, embedded system designers use compilers, assemblers, and debuggers to develop embedded system software.",
      "However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n\nIn circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).",
      "Utilities to add a checksum or CRC to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.",
      "For systems using digital signal processing, developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.",
      "System level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as processors, memories, DMA, interfaces, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks.",
      "Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis.",
      "Typical reports that helps designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.",
      "A model-based development tool creates and simulate graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.",
      "Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.",
      "An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as Forth or Basic.",
      "Another alternative is to add a real-time operating system or embedded operating system\nModeling and code generating tools often based on state machinesSoftware tools can come from several sources:\n\nSoftware companies that specialize in the embedded market\nPorted from the GNU software development tools\nSometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processorAs the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense.",
      "For example, cellphones, personal digital assistants and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics.",
      "In these systems, an open programming environment such as Linux, NetBSD, OSGi or Embedded Java is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.",
      "Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical applications.",
      "Some examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS.",
      "Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.",
      "== Debugging ==\nEmbedded debugging may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available.",
      "The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular program counter value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).",
      "From simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n\nInteractive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g.",
      "Forth and Basic)\nExternal debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the Remedy Debugger that even works for heterogeneous multicore systems.",
      "An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a JTAG or Nexus interface.",
      "This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor.",
      "An in-circuit emulator (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.",
      "A complete emulator provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC.",
      "The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.",
      "For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board.",
      "Tools such as Certus are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.",
      "This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.",
      "Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.Unless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation.",
      "The view of the code may be as HLL source-code, assembly code or mixture of both.",
      "Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary.",
      "For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).",
      "An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core.",
      "A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution.",
      "In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a logic analyzer, for instance.",
      "=== Tracing ===\nReal-time operating systems (RTOS) often supports tracing of operating system events.",
      "A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior.",
      "The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware.",
      "RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors.",
      "Commercial tools like RTXC Quadros or IAR Systems exists.",
      "=== Reliability ===\nEmbedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs.",
      "Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.",
      "Specific reliability issues may include:\n\nThe system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair.",
      "Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.",
      "The system must be kept running for safety reasons.",
      "\"Limp modes\" are less tolerable.",
      "Often backups are selected by an operator.",
      "Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.",
      "The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.A variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors—both software bugs such as memory leaks, and also soft errors in the hardware:\n\nwatchdog timer that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software \"limp modes\" that provide partial function\nDesigning with a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) architecture ensures a highly secure & reliable system environment\nA hypervisor designed for embedded systems, is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem component, so that a compromised software component cannot interfere with other subsystems, or privileged-level system software .",
      "This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from one subsystem to another, thereby improving reliability.",
      "This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.",
      "Immunity Aware Programming\n\n\n=== High vs. low volume ===\nFor high volume systems such as portable music players or mobile phones, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration.",
      "Engineers typically select hardware that is just “good enough” to implement the necessary functions.",
      "For low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a real-time operating system.",
      "== Embedded software architectures ==\n\nThere are several different types of software architecture in common use.",
      "=== Simple control loop ===\nIn this design, the software simply has a loop.",
      "The loop calls subroutines, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software.",
      "Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.",
      "=== Interrupt-controlled system ===\nSome embedded systems are predominantly controlled by interrupts.",
      "This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.",
      "These kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple.",
      "Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.",
      "Sometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure.",
      "Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop.",
      "This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.",
      "=== Cooperative multitasking ===\nA nonpreemptive multitasking system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an API.",
      "The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to “run” in.",
      "When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called “pause”, “wait”, “yield”, “nop” (stands for no operation), etc.",
      "The advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.",
      "=== Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading ===\nIn this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt).",
      "This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an \"operating system\" kernel.",
      "Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.",
      "As any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an MMU) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as message queues, semaphores or a non-blocking synchronization scheme.",
      "Because of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a real-time operating system (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a generic real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life.",
      "The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process.",
      "This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.",
      "The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases.",
      "Additionally the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on.",
      "These trends are leading to the uptake of embedded middleware in addition to a real-time operating system.",
      "=== Microkernels and exokernels ===\nA microkernel is a logical step up from a real-time OS.",
      "The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution.",
      "User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.",
      "In general, microkernels succeed when the task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.",
      "Exokernels communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls.",
      "The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.",
      "=== Monolithic kernels ===\nIn this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment.",
      "This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like Linux or Microsoft Windows, and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.",
      "Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are embedded Linux and Windows CE.",
      "Despite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as wireless routers and GPS navigation systems.",
      "Here are some of the reasons:\n\nPorts to common embedded chip sets are available.",
      "They permit re-use of publicly available code for device drivers, web servers, firewalls, and other code.",
      "Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.",
      "Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.",
      "Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in hardware.",
      "=== Additional software components ===\nIn addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components.",
      "These components consist of networking protocol stacks like CAN, TCP/IP, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS, and also included storage capabilities like FAT and flash memory management systems.",
      "If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system.",
      "In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included.",
      "In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.",
      "=== Domain-specific architectures ===\nIn the automotive sector, AUTOSAR is a standard architecture for embedded software.",

    "content": [
      "Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.",
      "One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.",
      "She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.",
      "Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College.",
      "Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old.",
      "She instead joined the Navy Reserves.",
      "Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.",
      "In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer.",
      "At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler.",
      "She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.",
      "Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers.",
      "By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.",
      "During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.",
      "In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC.",
      "In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language.",
      "This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words.",
      "In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty.",
      "She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.",
      "Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as \"Amazing Grace\".",
      "The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC.",
      "During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.",
      "A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.",
      "In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology.",
      "On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.",
      "== Early life and education ==\nHopper was born in New York City.",
      "She was the eldest of three children.",
      "Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.",
      "Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait.",
      "At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).",
      "For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey.",
      "Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year.",
      "She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.",
      "In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore.",
      "Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\", was published that same year.",
      "Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.She was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976) from 1930 until their divorce in 1945.",
      "She did not marry again, but chose to retain his surname.",
      "== Career ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nHopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II.",
      "She was rejected for multiple reasons.",
      "At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low.",
      "She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.",
      "During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES.",
      "She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg).",
      "She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.",
      "Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade.",
      "She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken.",
      "Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.",
      "Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38.",
      "She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve.",
      "Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.",
      "=== UNIVAC ===\nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I.  Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand.",
      "The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950,  and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English.\"",
      "Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952.",
      "In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done.",
      "The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.In 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler.",
      "She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it.",
      "They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"",
      "She goes on to say that her compiler \"translated mathematical notation into machine code.",
      "Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators.",
      "Very few people are really symbol manipulators.",
      "If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors.",
      "It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols.",
      "So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.",
      "That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors.",
      "I could say \"Subtract income tax from pay\" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.",
      "COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.",
      "\"In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.",
      "=== COBOL ===\n\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL).",
      "Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language).",
      "The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN.",
      "Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.",
      "Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumnus Jean E. Sammet.From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.",
      "She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.",
      "=== Standards ===\nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers.",
      "Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.",
      "She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.",
      "The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors.",
      "In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).",
      "== Retirement ==\n\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.",
      "She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment.",
      "She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972.",
      "She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res.",
      "341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion on 15 December 1983 to commodore by special Presidential appointment by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress.",
      "Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.",
      "Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986.",
      "At a celebration held in Boston on the USS Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).",
      "(Admirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy's history to serve on active duty at a higher age.",
      "Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral.)",
      "== Post-retirement ==\nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).",
      "Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process.",
      "She also sent a letter to Yavinsky's boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer.",
      "After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant.",
      "As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky.",
      "In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.",
      "She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.",
      "Hopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity.",
      "She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users.",
      "She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.",
      "Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures (which is not allowed under U.S. Department of Defense regulation 32 CFR 53.2(a)(2)).",
      "\"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler,\" she said, \"is training young people.\"",
      "They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?'",
      "I say, 'Try it.'",
      "And I back 'em up.",
      "They need that.",
      "I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.\"",
      "== Anecdotes ==\n\nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events.",
      "She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories.",
      "She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".",
      "While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay.",
      "While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase \"debugging\" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal \"debugging.\"",
      "For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering.",
      "The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\nGrace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid.",
      "People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long.",
      "She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.8 inches (30 cm))—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond.",
      "She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds.\"",
      "She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids.",
      "Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast.",
      "At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \"nanoseconds\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet (300 meters) long, representing a microsecond.",
      "Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.",
      "Jay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be \"'all Navy', but when you reach inside, you find a 'Pirate' dying to be released\".",
      "== Death ==\nOn New Year's Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia; she was 85 years of age.",
      "She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.",

      "Human–computer interaction (HCI) researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (users) and computers.",
      "Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways.",
      "As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study.",
      "The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P. Moran in their seminal 1983 book, The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction, although the authors first used the term in 1980 and the first known use was in 1975.",
      "The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a hammer, useful for driving nails but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer.",
      "The notion of dialog likens human–computer interaction to human-to-human interaction, an analogy which is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.",
      "== Introduction ==\nHumans interact with computers in many ways; the interface between humans and computers is crucial to facilitating this interaction.",
      "Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI) of today.",
      "Voice user interfaces (VUI) are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms.",
      "The growth in human–computer interaction field has been in quality of interaction, and in different branching in its history.",
      "Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches have had a different focus on the concepts of multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than command/action based ones, and finally active rather than passive interfaces.The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines human–computer interaction as \"a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them\".",
      "An important facet of HCI is user satisfaction (or simply End User Computing Satisfaction).",
      "\"Because human–computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side.",
      "On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are relevant.",
      "On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant.",
      "And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant.\"",
      "Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success.",
      "HCI is also sometimes termed human–machine interaction (HMI), man-machine interaction (MMI) or computer-human interaction (CHI).",
      "Poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems.",
      "A classic example is the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.",
      "Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instrument or throttle quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the \"standard\" layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results.",
      "== Goals for computers ==\nHuman–computer interaction studies the ways in which humans make, or do not make, use of computational artifacts, systems and infrastructures.",
      "In doing so, much of the research in the field seeks to improve human–computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces.",
      "How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and cultural values and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated.Much of the research in the field of human–computer interaction takes an interest in:\n\nMethods for designing new computer interfaces, thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability, findability,  efficiency of use.",
      "Methods for implementing interfaces, e.g., by means of software libraries.",
      "Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties.",
      "Methods for studying human computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly.",
      "Methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer.",
      "Models and theories of human computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces, such as cognitivist user models, Activity Theory or ethnomethodological accounts of human computer use.",
      "Perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design, computer use and HCI research practice.Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve vary.",
      "When pursuing a cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities.",
      "When pursuing a post-cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values.",
      "Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies, experimenting with devices, prototyping software and hardware systems, exploring interaction paradigms, and developing models and theories of interaction.",
      "== Differences with related fields ==\nHCI differs from human factors and ergonomics as HCI focuses more on users working specifically with computers, rather than other kinds of machines or designed artifacts.",
      "There is also a focus in HCI on how to implement the computer software and hardware mechanisms to support human–computer interaction.",
      "Thus, human factors is a broader term; HCI could be described as the human factors of computers – although some experts try to differentiate these areas.",
      "HCI also differs from human factors in that there is less of a focus on repetitive work-oriented tasks and procedures, and much less emphasis on physical stress and the physical form or industrial design of the user interface, such as keyboards and mouse devices.",
      "Three areas of study have substantial overlap with HCI even as the focus of inquiry shifts.",
      "Personal information management (PIM) studies how people acquire and use personal information (computer based and other) to complete tasks.",
      "In computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), emphasis is placed on the use of computing systems in support of the collaborative work.",
      "The principles of human interaction management (HIM) extend the scope of CSCW to an organizational level and can be implemented without use of computers.",
      "== Design ==\n\n\n=== Principles ===\n\nWhen evaluating a current user interface, or designing a new user interface, it is important to keep in mind the following experimental design principles:\n\nEarly focus on user(s) and task(s): Establish how many users are needed to perform the task(s) and determine who the appropriate users should be; someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user.",
      "In addition, define the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed.",
      "Empirical measurement: Test the interface early on with real users who come in contact with the interface on a daily basis.",
      "Keep in mind that results may vary with the performance level of the user and may not accurately depict the typical human–computer interaction.",
      "Establish quantitative usability specifics such as: the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s).",
      "Iterative design: After determining the users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, perform the following iterative design steps:\nDesign the user interface\nTest\nAnalyze results\nRepeatRepeat the iterative design process until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created.",
      "=== Methodologies ===\nA number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s.",
      "Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact.",
      "Early methodologies, for example, treated users' cognitive processes as predictable and quantifiable and encouraged design practitioners to look to cognitive science results in areas such as memory and attention when designing user interfaces.",
      "Modern models tend to focus on a constant feedback and conversation between users, designers, and engineers and push for technical systems to be wrapped around the types of experiences users want to have, rather than wrapping user experience around a completed system.",
      "Activity theory: used in HCI to define and study the context in which human interactions with computers take place.",
      "Activity theory provides a framework to reason about actions in these contexts, analytical tools with the format of checklists of items that researchers should consider, and informs design of interactions from an activity-centric perspective.",
      "User-centered design: user-centered design (UCD) is a modern, widely practiced design philosophy rooted in the idea that users must take center-stage in the design of any computer system.",
      "Users, designers and technical practitioners work together to articulate the needs and limitations of the user and create a system that addresses these elements.",
      "Often, user-centered design projects are informed by ethnographic studies of the environments in which users will be interacting with the system.",
      "This practice is similar to participatory design, which emphasizes the possibility for end-users to contribute actively through shared design sessions and workshops.",
      "Principles of user interface design: these principles may be considered at any time during the design of a user interface in any order: tolerance, simplicity, visibility, affordance, consistency, structure and feedback.",
      "Value sensitive design (VSD): a method for building technology that account for the values of the people who use the technology directly, as well as those who the technology affects, either directly or indirectly.",
      "VSD uses an iterative design process that involves three types of investigations: conceptual, empirical and technical.",
      "Conceptual investigations aim at understanding and articulating the various stakeholders of the technology, as well as their values and any values conflicts that might arise for these stakeholders through the use of the technology.",
      "Empirical investigations are qualitative or quantitative design research studies used to inform the designers' understanding of the users' values, needs, and practices.",
      "Technical investigations can involve either analysis of how people use related technologies, or the design of systems to support values identified in the conceptual and empirical investigations.",
      "== Display designs ==\nDisplays are human-made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and to facilitate further processing of that information.",
      "Before a display is designed, the task that the display is intended to support must be defined (e.g.",
      "navigating, controlling, decision making, learning, entertaining, etc.).",
      "A user or operator must be able to process whatever information that a system generates and displays; therefore, the information must be displayed according to principles in a manner that will support perception, situation awareness, and understanding.",
      "=== Thirteen principles of display design ===\nChristopher Wickens et al.",
      "defined 13 principles of display design in their book An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering.These principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design.",
      "A reduction in errors, a reduction in required training time, an increase in efficiency, and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved through utilization of these principles.",
      "Certain principles may not be applicable to different displays or situations.",
      "Some principles may seem to be conflicting, and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another.",
      "The principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation.",
      "Striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design.",
      "==== Perceptual principles ====\n1.",
      "Make displays legible (or audible).",
      "A display's legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display.",
      "If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, then the operator cannot effectively make use of them.",
      "Avoid absolute judgment limits.",
      "Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable on the basis of a single sensory variable (e.g.",
      "colour, size, loudness).",
      "These sensory variables can contain many possible levels.",
      "Top-down processing.",
      "Signals are likely perceived and interpreted in accordance with what is expected based on a user's experience.",
      "If a signal is presented contrary to the user's expectation, more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly.",
      "Redundancy gain.",
      "If a signal is presented more than once, it is more likely that it will be understood correctly.",
      "This can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms (e.g.",
      "colour and shape, voice and print, etc.",
      "), as redundancy does not imply repetition.",
      "A traffic light is a good example of redundancy, as colour and position are redundant.",
      "Similarity causes confusion: Use distinguishable elements.",
      "Signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused.",
      "The ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar.",
      "For example, A423B9 is more similar to A423B8 than 92 is to 93.",
      "Unnecessarily similar features should be removed and dissimilar features should be highlighted.",
      "==== Mental model principles ====\n6.",
      "Principle of pictorial realism.",
      "A display should look like the variable that it represents (e.g.",
      "high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level).",
      "If there are multiple elements, they can be configured in a manner that looks like it would in the represented environment.",
      "Principle of the moving part.",
      "Moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user's mental model of how it actually moves in the system.",
      "For example, the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude.",
      "==== Principles based on attention ====\n8.",
      "Minimizing information access cost or interaction cost.",
      "When the user's attention is diverted from one location to another to access necessary information, there is an associated cost in time or effort.",
      "A display design should minimize this cost by allowing for frequently accessed sources to be located at the nearest possible position.",
      "However, adequate legibility should not be sacrificed to reduce this cost.",
      "Proximity compatibility principle.",
      "Divided attention between two information sources may be necessary for the completion of one task.",
      "These sources must be mentally integrated and are defined to have close mental proximity.",
      "Information access costs should be low, which can be achieved in many ways (e.g.",
      "proximity, linkage by common colours, patterns, shapes, etc.).",
      "However, close display proximity can be harmful by causing too much clutter.",
      "Principle of multiple resources.",
      "A user can more easily process information across different resources.",
      "For example, visual and auditory information can be presented simultaneously rather than presenting all visual or all auditory information.",
      "==== Memory principles ====\n11.",
      "Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world.",
      "A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long-term memory.",
      "A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory.",
      "However, the use of memory may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some type of knowledge in the world (e.g., an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual).",
      "The use of knowledge in a user's head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design.",
      "Principle of predictive aiding.",
      "Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions.",
      "A display should attempt to eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the use of the user's mental resources.",
      "This will allow the user to focus on current conditions, and to consider possible future conditions.",
      "An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination.",
      "Principle of consistency.",
      "Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support processing of new displays if they are designed consistently.",
      "A user's long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate.",
      "A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays.",
      "== Human–computer interface ==\n\nThe human–computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer.",
      "The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction.",
      "The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including:\n\nVisual Based :The visual based human computer inter-action is probably the most widespread area in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research.",
      "Audio Based : The audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of in HCI systems.",
      "This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals.",
      "Task environment: The conditions and goals set upon the user.",
      "Machine environment: The environment that the computer is connected to, e.g.",
      "a laptop in a college student's dorm room.",
      "Areas of the interface: Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer not pertaining to their interaction.",
      "Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes pertaining to their interaction.",
      "Input flow: The flow of information that begins in the task environment, when the user has some task that requires using their computer.",
      "Output: The flow of information that originates in the machine environment.",
      "Feedback: Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back.",
      "Fit: This is the match between the computer design, the user and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task.",
      "== Current research ==\nTopics in human-computer interaction include:\n\n\n=== User customization ===\nEnd-user development studies how ordinary users could routinely tailor applications to their own needs and to invent new applications based on their understanding of their own domains.",
      "With their deeper knowledge, users could increasingly be important sources of new applications at the expense of generic programmers with systems expertise but low domain expertise.",
      "=== Embedded computation ===\nComputation is passing beyond computers into every object for which uses can be found.",
      "Embedded systems make the environment alive with little computations and automated processes, from computerized cooking appliances to lighting and plumbing fixtures to window blinds to automobile braking systems to greeting cards.",
      "The expected difference in the future is the addition of networked communications that will allow many of these embedded computations to coordinate with each other and with the user.",
      "Human interfaces to these embedded devices will in many cases be disparate from those appropriate to workstations.",
      "=== Augmented reality ===\n\nAugmented reality refers to the notion of layering relevant information into our vision of the world.",
      "Existing projects show real-time statistics to users performing difficult tasks, such as manufacturing.",
      "Future work might include augmenting our social interactions by providing additional information about those we converse with.",
      "=== Social computing ===\nIn recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis.",
      "Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology.",
      "For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name.",
      "Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more positively than humans, despite behaving the same way towards these machines.",
      "=== Knowledge-driven human–computer interaction ===\nIn human and computer interactions, a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors.",
      "Ontology (information science), as a formal representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem, through solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties.",
      "=== Emotions and human-computer interaction ===\nIn the interaction of humans and computers, research has studied how computers can detect, process and react to human emotions to develop emotionally intelligent information systems.",
      "Researchers have suggested several 'affect-detection channels'.",
      "The potential of telling human emotions in an automated and digital fashion lies in improvements to the effectiveness of human-computer interaction.",
      "The influence of emotions in human-computer interaction has been studied in fields such as financial decision making using ECG and organisational knowledge sharing using eye tracking and face readers as affect-detection channels.",
      "In these fields it has been shown that affect-detection channels have the potential to detect human emotions and that information systems can incorporate the data obtained from affect-detection channels to improve decision models.",
      "=== Brain–computer interfaces ===\n\n\n== Factors of change ==\nTraditionally, computer use was modeled as a human–computer dyad in which the two were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel, such as text-based terminals.",
      "Much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication.",
      "Because of potential issues, human–computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by D. Engelbart: \"If ease of use was the only valid criterion, people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles.",
      "\"The means by which humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly.",
      "Human–computer interaction is affected by developments in computing.",
      "These forces include:\n\nDecreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems\nMiniaturization of hardware leading to portability\nReduction in power requirements leading to portability\nNew display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms\nSpecialized hardware leading to new functions\nIncreased development of network communication and distributed computing\nIncreasingly widespread use of computers, especially by people who are outside of the computing profession\nIncreasing innovation in input techniques (e.g., voice, gesture, pen), combined with lowering cost, leading to rapid computerization by people formerly left out of the computer revolution.",
      "Wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groupsAs of 2010 the future for HCI is expected to include the following characteristics:\n\nUbiquitous computing and communication.",
      "Computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks, nationally over wide-area networks, and portably via infrared, ultrasonic, cellular, and other technologies.",
      "Data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels.",
      "High-functionality systems.",
      "Systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them.",
      "There are so many systems that most users, technical or non-technical, do not have time to learn them in the traditional way (e.g., through thick manuals).",
      "Mass availability of computer graphics.",
      "Computer graphics capabilities such as image processing, graphics transformations, rendering, and interactive animation are becoming widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices.",
      "Mixed media.",
      "Commercial systems can handle images, voice, sounds, video, text, formatted data.",
      "These are exchangeable over communication links among users.",
      "The separate fields of consumer electronics (e.g., stereo sets, VCRs, televisions) and computers are merging partly.",
      "Computer and print fields are expected to cross-assimilate.",
      "High-bandwidth interaction.",
      "The rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed, computer graphics, new media, and new input/output devices.",
      "This can lead to some qualitatively different interfaces, such as virtual reality or computational video.",
      "Large and thin displays.",
      "New display technologies are maturing, enabling very large displays and displays that are thin, lightweight, and low in power use.",
      "This is having large effects on portability and will likely enable developing paper-like, pen-based computer interaction systems very different in feel from present desktop workstations.",
      "Information utilities.",
      "Public information utilities (such as home banking and shopping) and specialized industry services (e.g., weather for pilots) are expected to proliferate.",
      "The rate of proliferation can accelerate with the introduction of high-bandwidth interaction and the improvement in quality of interfaces.",
      "== Scientific conferences ==\nOne of the main conferences for new research in human–computer interaction is the annually held Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, usually referred to by its short name CHI (pronounced kai, or khai).",
      "CHI is organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction (SIGCHI).",
      "CHI is a large conference, with thousands of attendants, and is quite broad in scope.",
      "It is attended by academics, practitioners and industry people, with company sponsors such as Google, Microsoft, and PayPal.",

      "Intel Corporation (commonly known as Intel and stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in the Silicon Valley.",
      "It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).",
      "Intel ranked No.",
      "46 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell.",
      "Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.",
      "Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore (of Moore's law), and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove.",
      "The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip).",
      "The fact that \"intel\" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.",
      "Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981.",
      "Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.",
      "During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry.",
      "During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Mesa3D, Intel Array Building Blocks, and Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.",
      "== Current operations ==\n\n\n=== Operating segments ===\nClient Computing Group –  55% of 2016 revenues –  produces hardware components used in desktop and notebook computers.",
      "Data Center Group –  29% of 2016 revenues –  produces hardware components used in server, network, and storage platforms.",
      "Internet of Things Group –  5% of 2016 revenues –  offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use.",
      "Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group –  4% of 2016 revenues –  manufactures NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.",
      "Intel Security Group –  4% of 2016 revenues –  produces software, particularly security, and antivirus software.",
      "Programmable Solutions Group –  3% of 2016 revenues –  manufactures programmable semiconductors (primarily FPGAs).",
      "=== Top customers ===\nIn 2017, Dell accounted for about 16% of Intel's total revenues, Lenovo accounted for 13% of total revenues, and HP Inc. accounted for 11% of total revenues.",
      "=== Market share ===\n\n\n==== Market share in early 2011 ====\nAccording to IDC, while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market (73.3%) and the mobile PC microprocessor (80.4%) in the second quarter of 2011, the numbers decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2011.",
      "==== Historical market share ====\nIn the 1980s, Intel was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors (10th in 1987) in the world.",
      "In 1992, Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and has held the position ever since.",
      "Other top semiconductor companies include TSMC, Advanced Micro Devices, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and STMicroelectronics.",
      "==== Major competitors ====\nCompetitors in PC chipsets include Advanced Micro Devices, VIA Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, and Nvidia.",
      "Intel's competitors in networking include NXP Semiconductors, Infineon, Broadcom Limited, Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, and competitors in flash memory include Spansion, Samsung, Qimonda, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics, and SK Hynix.",
      "The only major competitor in the x86 processor market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time.",
      "However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.Some smaller competitors such as VIA Technologies produce low-power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment.",
      "However, the advent of such mobile computing devices, in particular, smartphones, has in recent years led to a decline in PC sales.",
      "Since over 95% of the world's smartphones currently use processors designed by ARM Holdings, ARM has become a major competitor for Intel's processor market.",
      "ARM is also planning to make inroads into the PC and server market.Intel has been involved in several disputes regarding violation of antitrust laws, which are noted below.",
      "== Corporate history ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nIntel was founded in Mountain View, California, in 1968 by Gordon E. Moore (of \"Moore's law\" fame), a chemist, and Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit.",
      "Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist) helped them find investors, while Max Palevsky was on the board from an early stage.",
      "Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel.",
      "Rock was not an employee, but he was an investor and was chairman of the board.",
      "The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock.",
      "Just 2 years later, Intel became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share).",
      "Intel's third employee was Andy Grove, a chemical engineer, who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.",
      "In deciding on a name, Moore and Noyce quickly rejected \"Moore Noyce\", near homophone for \"more noise\" – an ill-suited name for an electronics company, since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference.",
      "Instead, they founded the company as N M Electronics on July 18, 1968, but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel which stood for Integrated Electronics.",
      "Since \"Intel\" was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco, they had to buy the rights for the name.",
      "=== Early history ===\nAt its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices.",
      "The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market, widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory.",
      "Its first product, a quick entry into the small, high-speed memory market in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.",
      "In the same year, Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory (ROM) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101.",
      "While the 1101 was a significant advance, its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories.",
      "The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the 1103 released in 1970, solved these issues.",
      "The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972, as it replaced core memory in many applications.",
      "Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.",
      "While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 and one of the first microcomputers in 1972, by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips.",
      "However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market.",
      "The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model.",
      "Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.",
      "The development of the micro-processor by Intel, (1971): The micro-processor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry.",
      "A micro-processor miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer, which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do.",
      "Considerable technological innovation was needed before the micro-processor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a \"mini computer\" and then known as a \"personal computer\".By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market, Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination.",
      "Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987.",
      "By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991, Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of Pentium processors had become a household name.",
      "=== Slowing demand and challenges to dominance in 2000 ===\nAfter 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed.",
      "Competitors, notably AMD (Intel's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced.",
      "In the early 2000s then-CEO, Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.",
      "=== Litigation ===\nIntel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation.",
      "US law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).",
      "During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU.",
      "The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits.",
      "Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991.",
      "In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.",
      "=== Regaining of momentum (2005–2007) ===\nIn 2005, CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).",
      "In 2006, Intel unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim; the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field.",
      "In 2008, Intel had another \"tick\" when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture, which was 45 nm.",
      "Later that year, Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture.",
      "Nehalem had positive reviews.",
      "=== Sale of XScale processor business (2006) ===\nOn June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced.",
      "Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated $600 million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities.",
      "The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses, and the acquisition completed on November 9, 2006.",
      "=== Acquisitions and investments (2010–present) ===\nIn 2010, Intel purchased McAfee, a manufacturer of computer security technology, for $7.68 billion.",
      "As a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction, Intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel's chips and personal computers.",
      "After the acquisition, Intel had about 90,000 employees, including about 12,000 software engineers.",
      "In September 2016, Intel sold a majority stake in its computer-security unit to TPG Capital, reversing the five-year-old McAfee acquisition.In August 2010, Intel and Infineon Technologies announced that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business.",
      "Intel planned to use Infineon's technology in laptops, smart phones, netbooks, tablets and embedded computers in consumer products, eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel's silicon chips.In March 2011, Intel bought most of the assets of Cairo-based SySDSoft.In July 2011, Intel announced that it had agreed to acquire Fulcrum Microsystems Inc., a company specializing in network switches.",
      "The company used to be included on the EE Times list of 60 Emerging Startups.In October 2011, Intel reached a deal to acquire Telmap, an Israeli-based navigation software company.",
      "The purchase price was not disclosed, but Israeli media reported values around $300 million to $350 million.In July 2012, Intel agreed to buy 10% of the shares of ASML Holding NV for $2.1 billion and another $1 billion for 5% of the shares that need shareholder approval to fund relevant research and development efforts, as part of a EUR3.3 billion ($4.1 billion) deal to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet lithography by as much as two years.In July 2013, Intel confirmed the acquisition of Omek Interactive, an Israeli company that makes technology for gesture-based interfaces, without disclosing the monetary value of the deal.",
      "An official statement from Intel read: \"The acquisition of Omek Interactive will help increase Intel's capabilities in the delivery of more immersive perceptual computing experiences.\"",
      "One report estimated the value of the acquisition between US$30 million and $50 million.The acquisition of a Spanish natural language recognition startup, Indisys was announced in September 2013.",
      "The terms of the deal were not disclosed but an email from an Intel representative stated: \"Intel has acquired Indisys, a privately held company based in Seville, Spain.",
      "The majority of Indisys employees joined Intel.",
      "We signed the agreement to acquire the company on May 31 and the deal has been completed.\"",
      "Indysis explains that its artificial intelligence (AI) technology \"is a human image, which converses fluently and with common sense in multiple languages and also works in different platforms.",
      "\"In December 2014, Intel bought PasswordBox.In January 2015, Intel purchased a 30% stake in Vuzix, a smart glasses manufacturer.",
      "The deal was worth $24.8 million.In February 2015, Intel announced its agreement to purchase German network chipmaker Lantiq, to aid in its expansion of its range of chips in devices with Internet connection capability.In June 2015, Intel announced its agreement to purchase FPGA design company Altera for $16.7 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.",
      "The acquisition completed in December 2015.In October 2015, Intel bought cognitive computing company Saffron Technology for an undisclosed price.In August 2016, Intel purchased deep-learning startup Nervana Systems for $350 million.In December 2016, Intel acquired computer vision startup Movidius for an undisclosed price.In March 2017, Intel announced that they had agreed to purchase Mobileye, an Israeli developer of \"autonomous driving\" systems for US$15.3 billion.In June 2017, Intel Corporation announced an investment of over Rs.1100 crore ($170 million) for its upcoming Research and Development (R&D) centre in Bangalore.In January 2019, Intel announced an investment of over $11 billion on a new Israeli chip plant, as told by the Israeli Finance Minister.",
      "==== Acquisition table (2009–present) ====\n\n\n==== Expansions (2008–2011) ====\nIn 2008, Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company, SpectraWatt Inc.",
      "In 2011, SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy.In February 2011, Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, completed in 2013 at a cost of $5 billion.",
      "The building was never used.",
      "The company produces three-quarters of its products in the United States, although three-quarters of its revenue come from overseas.In April 2011, Intel began a pilot project with ZTE Corporation to produce smartphones using the Intel Atom processor for China's domestic market.",
      "In December 2011, Intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group that would be responsible for the company's smartphone, tablet, and wireless efforts.",
      "==== Opening up the foundries to other manufacturers (2013) ====\nFinding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using 14-nm process.",
      "General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future.",
      "This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.As of July 2013, five companies were using Intel's fabs via the Intel Custom Foundry division: Achronix, Tabula, Netronome, Microsemi, and Panasonic –  most are field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors.",
      "Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the 22-nm Tri-Gate process.",
      "Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.",
      "Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online.",
      "Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.In October 2018, Arm Holdings partnered with Intel in order to share code for embedded systems through the Yocto Project.",
      "== Product and market history ==\n\n\n=== SRAMS and the microprocessor ===\nIntel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s.",
      "Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel's first microprocessor.",
      "Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s.",
      "(Note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor)\n\n\n=== From DRAM to microprocessors ===\nIn 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors.",
      "Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive.",
      "A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular 8086 microprocessor.",
      "Until then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier, but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories, and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as Zilog and AMD.",
      "When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.",
      "=== Intel, x86 processors, and the IBM PC ===\n\nDespite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel.",
      "As the next processor, the 8086 (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed \"Operation Crush\", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible.",
      "One design win was the newly created IBM PC division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.",
      "IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful.",
      "In 1982, Intel created the 80286 microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the IBM PC/AT.",
      "Compaq, the first IBM PC \"clone\" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.",
      "In 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432.",
      "The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace.",
      "Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead.",
      "==== 386 microprocessor ====\nDuring this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company, closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business.",
      "Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to \"single-source\" the 386 microprocessor.",
      "Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers.",
      "To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply.",
      "The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD, with which Intel had a technology-sharing contract.",
      "Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead, producing it in three geographically distinct factories: Santa Clara, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.",
      "He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery.",
      "In doing this, Intel breached its contract with AMD, which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer.",
      "(Instead, AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x86 designs.)",
      "As the success of Compaq's Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier.",
      "Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.",
      "==== 486, Pentium, and Itanium ====\nIntel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 established a second design team, designing the processors code-named \"P5\" and \"P6\" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken.",
      "Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip.",
      "The P5 project was earlier known as \"Operation Bicycle,\" referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines.",
      "The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium, substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number (numbers, such as 486, cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States).",
      "The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997.",
      "New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.",
      "The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture, codenamed \"P7\".",
      "The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett-Packard engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility.",
      "The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001.",
      "The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T).",
      "In 2017, Intel announced that the Itanium 9700 series (Kittson) would be the last Itanium chips produced.The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.",
      "==== Pentium flaw ====\n\nIn June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor.",
      "Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect.",
      "The error could compound in subsequent calculations.",
      "Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs (which were limited to some 60, 66, 75, 90, and 100 MHz models) on customer request.",
      "The bug was discovered independently in October 1994 by Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College.",
      "He contacted Intel but received no response.",
      "On October 30, he posted a message about his finding on the Internet.",
      "Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press.",
      "The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system.",
      "Consequently, many users did not accept Intel's statements that the error was minor and \"not even an erratum.\"",
      "During Thanksgiving, in 1994, The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error.",
      "Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization.",
      "This resulted in a $475 million charge against Intel's 1994 revenue.",
      "Dr. Nicely later learned that Intel had discovered the FDIV bug in its own testing a few months before him (but had decided not to inform customers).The \"Pentium flaw\" incident, Intel's response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name.",
      "Dovetailing with an uptick in the \"Intel Inside\" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.",
      "==== \"Intel Inside\" and other campaigns ====\n\nDuring this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns.",
      "The first campaign, the 1991 \"Intel Inside\" marketing and branding campaign, is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself.",
      "The idea of \"ingredient branding\" was new at the time, with only NutraSweet and a few others making attempts to do so.",
      "This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.",
      "The second campaign, Intel's Systems Group, which began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC motherboards, the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.",
      "The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign.",
      "Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured \"white box\" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.",
      "At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and Universal Serial Bus (USB).",
      "IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft.",
      "The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).",
      "==== 2018 security flaws ====\n\nIn early January 2018, it was reported that all Intel processors made since 1995 (besides Intel Itanium and pre-2013 Intel Atom) have been subject to two security flaws dubbed Meltdown and Spectre.The impact on performance resulting from software patches is \"workload-dependent\".",
      "Several procedures to help protect home computers and related devices from the Spectre (and Meltdown) security vulnerabilities have been published.",
      "Spectre patches have been reported to significantly slow down performance, especially on older computers; on the newer 8th generation Core platforms, benchmark performance drops of 2–14 percent have been measured.",
      "Meltdown patches may also produce performance loss.",
      "It is believed that \"hundreds of millions\" of systems could be affected by these flaws.On March 15, 2018, Intel reported that it will redesign its CPU processors (performance losses to be determined) to protect against the Spectre security vulnerability, and expects to release the newly redesigned processors later in 2018.On May 3, 2018, eight additional Spectre-class flaws were reported.",
      "Intel reported that they are preparing new patches to mitigate these flaws.On August 14, 2018, Intel disclosed three additional chip flaws referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF).",
      "They reported that previously released microcode updates, along with new, pre-release microcode updates can be used to mitigate these flaws.",
      "==== Remote Keyboard Android App ====\nIntel has decided to discontinue with their recent Intel Remote Keyboard Android app after encountering several security bugs.",
      "This app was launched in early 2015 to help users control Intel single-board computers and Intel NUC.",
      "The company has asked Remote Keyboard Users to delete the app at their first convenience.",
      "=== Solid-state drives (SSD) ===\n\nIn 2008, Intel began shipping mainstream solid-state drives (SSDs) with up to 160 GB storage capacities.",
      "As with their CPUs, Intel develops SSD chips using ever-smaller nanometer processes.",
      "These SSDs make use of industry standards such as NAND flash, mSATA, PCIe, and NVMe.",
      "In 2017, Intel introduced SSDs based on 3D XPoint technology under the Optane brand name.",
      "=== Supercomputers ===\nThe Intel Scientific Computers division was founded in 1984 by Justin Rattner, to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology.",
      "In 1992, the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division, and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed.",
      "The division designed several supercomputer systems, including the Intel iPSC/1, iPSC/2, iPSC/860, Paragon and ASCI Red.",
      "In November 2014, Intel revealed that it is going to use light beams to speed up supercomputers.",
      "=== Mobile Linux software ===\nIn 2007 Intel formed the Moblin project to create an open source Linux operating system for x86-based mobile devices.",
      "Following the success of Google's Android platform which ran exclusively on ARM processors, Intel announced on February 15, 2010, that it would partner with Nokia and merge Moblin with Nokia's ARM-based Maemo project to create MeeGo.",
      "MeeGo was supported by the Linux Foundation.In February 2011 Nokia left the project after partnering with Microsoft, leaving Intel in sole charge of MeeGo.",
      "An Intel spokeswoman said it was \"disappointed\" by Nokia's decision but that Intel was committed to MeeGo.",
      "In September 2011 Intel stopped working on MeeGo and partnered with Samsung to create Tizen, a new project hosted by the Linux Foundation.",
      "Intel has since been co-developing the Tizen operating system which runs on several Samsung devices.",
      "=== Competition, antitrust and espionage ===\n\nTwo factors combined to end this dominance: the slowing of PC demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low-cost PC.",
      "By the end of the 1990s, microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power.",
      "Aside from high-end server systems and software, whose demand dropped with the end of the \"dot-com bubble\", consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low-cost systems after 2000.",
      "Intel's strategy of producing ever-more-powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled, leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors, notably AMD.",
      "This, in turn, lowered the profitability of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel.Intel's dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years, including FTC investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999, and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and a patent suit by Intergraph.",
      "Intel's market dominance (at one time it controlled over 85% of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors) combined with Intel's own hardball legal tactics (such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers) made it an attractive target for litigation, but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything.A case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both Intel and AMD.",
      "Bill Gaede, an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel's Arizona plant, was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers.",
      "Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD, which immediately alerted Intel and authorities, resulting in Gaede's arrest.",
      "Gaede was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996.",
      "=== Use of Intel products by Apple Computer (2005–present) ===\n\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, announced that Apple would be transitioning from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x86 architecture because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple's needs.",

      "=== Marketing ===\n\n\n==== Intel Inside ====\nIntel has become one of the world's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running Intel Inside campaign.",
      "The idea for \"Intel Inside\" came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers, MicroAge.In the late 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (now AMD), Zilog, and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers.",
      "This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market.",
      "In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion.",
      "MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary –  although indirect –  driver of demand for microprocessors.",
      "Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips.",
      "However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted.",
      "Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right.",
      "But Mion felt that the public didn't really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they just needed to feel they were better.",
      "So Mion proposed a market test.",
      "Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, \"If you're buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside.\"",
      "In turn, MicroAge would put \"Intel Inside\" stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area.",
      "To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store.",
      "Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs.",
      "Intel very quickly adopted \"Intel Inside\" as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.As is often the case with computer lore, other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved.",
      "\"Intel Inside\" has not escaped that tendency and there are other \"explanations\" that had been floating around.",
      "Intel's branding campaign started with \"The Computer Inside\" tagline in 1990 in the US and Europe.",
      "The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an \"Intel in it\" tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI-KON (meaning \"Station Concert\" in Japanese) at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day, December 25, 1990.",
      "Several months later, \"The Computer Inside\" incorporated the Japan idea to become \"Intel Inside\" which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991, by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter.",
      "The case study of the Inside Intel Inside was put together by Harvard Business School.",
      "The five-note jingle was introduced in 1994 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world.",
      "The initial branding agency for the \"Intel Inside\" campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City.",
      "The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove.The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers.",
      "Intel paid some of the advertiser's costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle.",
      "In 2008, Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet.",
      "Intel required that a minimum of 35% of the money it provided to the companies in its co-op program be used for online marketing.",
      "The Intel 2010 annual financial report indicated that $1.8 billion (6% of the gross margin and nearly 16% of the total net income) was allocated to all advertising with Intel Inside being part of that.",
      "==== Sonic logo ====\nThe famous D♭  D♭  G♭  D♭  A♭ xylophone/xylomarimba jingle, sonic logo, tag, audio mnemonic was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa, once a member of the Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss.",
      "The sonic Intel logo was remade in 1999 to coincide with the launch of the Pentium III, and a second time in 2004 to coincide with the new logo change (although it overlapped with the 1999 version and was not mainstreamed until the launch of the Core processors in 2006), with the melody unchanged.",
      "Advertisements for products featuring Intel processors with prominent MMX branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment after the final note.",
      "==== Processor naming strategy ====\nIn 2006, Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino, to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro.",
      "In mid-January 2006, Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors.",
      "The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD).",

      "As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all.",
      "High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.Apple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby.",
      "Like any rechargeable battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable.",
      "In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping.",
      "As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved.",
      "The refurbished unit will have a new case.",
      "The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.",
      "Independent companies also provide a battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case.",
      "Alternatively it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery.",
      "The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.",
      "=== Storage ===\nThe iPad was released with three capacity options for storage: 16, 32, or 64 GB of internal flash memory.",
      "On January 29, 2013, Apple announced a 128 GB model of the fourth generation iPad, which was released on February 5.",
      "All data is stored on the internal flash memory, with no option to expand storage.",
      "Apple sells a \"camera connection kit\" with an SD card reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.",
      "On March 21, 2016, Apple announced a 256 GB model of the iPad Pro, which was released on March 31.",
      "In 2017, Apple released a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a revised 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a 512 GB option, the first of its kind on an iOS device.",
      "In 2018, Apple released a 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, both with a 1 TB option.",
      "Apple iOS, in combination with their specific hardware, uses crypto-shredding when activating the \"Erase all content and settings\" by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage'.",
      "This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.",
      "=== Cellular connectivity ===\niPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support.",
      "The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity.",
      "The side of the Wi-Fi + 3G iPad had a micro-SIM slot (not mini-SIM).",
      "The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold 'locked' to specific carriers.",
      "On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.The second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5.",
      "The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide.",
      "Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev.",
      "A and Rev.",
      "The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide.",
      "The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, penta-band UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev.",
      "A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40.",
      "Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction.",
      "Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).",
      "=== Accessories ===\n\nApple offers several iPad accessories, most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.",
      "A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port.",
      "Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock.",
      "A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs.",
      "The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter (\"wall charger\") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.",
      "Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to USB Type A, the other an SD card reader.",
      "Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card\nor MIDI keyboard.",
      "A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and MicroSD on a single unit.",
      "An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors.",
      "Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations.",
      "Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.",
      "While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4.",
      "The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.",
      "While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen.",
      "Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed).",
      "There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive.",
      "Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.",
      "In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.",
      "== Software ==\n\nLike the iPhone, with which it shares a development environment the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.",
      "The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.",
      "Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features, and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016.",
      "Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.",
      "The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2.",
      "On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.",
      "=== Interface ===\n\nThe interface is centred around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications.",
      "The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen.",
      "Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons.",
      "Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes.",
      "Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.",
      "Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch.",
      "The iPad's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger.",
      "For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"pinching\".",
      "Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back.",
      "In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction.",
      "In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.",
      "Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side.",
      "Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary.",
      "Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif.",
      "In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.",
      "=== Multimedia ===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to an iPod or current Symbian S60 phones.",
      "The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations.",
      "Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.",
      "The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.",
      "Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle.",
      "Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library.",
      "Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen.",
      "Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.",
      "The iPad supports gapless playback.",
      "Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen.",
      "Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.",
      "The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad.",
      "It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera.",
      "The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari.",
      "The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera.",
      "Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.",
      "=== Internet connectivity ===\nThe iPad can use Wi-Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps.",

      "In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, \"With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands.",
      "It offers [the major media companies] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you.\"",
      "But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood, saying, \"Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too.\"",

      "In September 2018, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are the iPhone XS, an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, iPhone XS Max, a larger variant with the series' biggest display as of 2018 and iPhone XR, a lower end version of the iPhone X.",
      "The original iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry.",
      "Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise.",
      "The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.",
      "== History and availability ==\n\nDevelopment of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees (including Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac and iPod) to work on the highly confidential \"Project Purple.\"",
      "Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone.",
      "Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (which became AT&T Mobility) at the time—at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months.According to Steve Jobs, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and therefore \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.Apple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola.",
      "Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano.Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house and even paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive US sales, until 2011.Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.",
      "The two initial models, a 4 GB model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model at US$599 (both requiring a two-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.",
      "The passionate reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'.",
      "Following this successful release in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK, France, and Germany in November 2007, and Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.",
      "On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six.",
      "Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories.",
      "Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the US, Canada and major European countries on June 19.",
      "Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost, and 40% of users had household incomes over US$100,000.The back of the original first generation iPhone was made of aluminum with a black plastic accent.",

      "Sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 temporarily surpassed those of Research In Motion's (RIM) BlackBerry sales of 5.2 million units, which briefly made Apple the third largest mobile phone manufacturer by revenue, after Nokia and Samsung (however, some of this income is deferred).",
      "Recorded sales grew steadily thereafter, and by the end of fiscal year 2010, a total of 73.5 million iPhones had been sold.By 2010, the iPhone had a market share of barely 4% of all cell phones; however, Apple pulled in more than 50% of the total profit that global cellphone sales generated.",
      "Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones in the third quarter of 2010, representing a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter, which was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter.",
      "Apple's sales surpassed that of Research in Motion's 12.1 million BlackBerry units sold in their most recent quarter ended August 2010.",
      "In the United States market alone for the third quarter of 2010, while there were 9.1 million Android-powered smartphones shipped for 43.6% of the market, Apple iOS was the number two phone operating system with 26.2% but the 5.5 million iPhones sold made it the most popular single device.On March 2, 2011, at the iPad 2 launch event, Apple announced that they had sold 100 million iPhones worldwide.",
      "As a result of the success of the iPhone sales volume and high selling price, headlined by the iPhone 4S, Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia.",
      "While the Samsung Galaxy S II proved more popular than the iPhone 4S in parts of Europe, the iPhone 4S was dominant in the United States.In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37 million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660.",
      "The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.For the eight largest phone manufacturers in Q1 2012, according to Horace Dediu at Asymco, Apple and Samsung combined to take 99% of industry profits (HTC took the remaining 1%, while RIM, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Nokia all suffered losses), with Apple earning 73 cents out of every dollar earned by the phone makers.",
      "As the industry profits grew from $5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 to $14.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012 (quadruple the profits in 2007), Apple had managed to increase its share of these profits.",
      "This is due to increasing carrier subsidies and the high selling prices of the iPhone, which had a negative effect on the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold an increasing number of iPhones.",
      "By the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Apple's sales from the iPhone alone (at $22.7 billion) exceeded the total of Microsoft from all of its businesses ($17.4 billion).In the fourth quarter of 2012, the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S were the best-selling handsets with sales of 27.4 million (13% of smartphones worldwide) and 17.4 million units, respectively, with the Samsung Galaxy S III in third with 15.4 million.",
      "According to Strategy Analytics' data, this was \"an impressive performance, given the iPhone portfolio's premium pricing\", adding that the Galaxy S III's global popularity \"appears to have peaked\" (the Galaxy S III was touted as an iPhone-killer by some in the press when it was released).",
      "While Samsung has led in worldwide sales of smartphones, Apple's iPhone line has still managed to top Samsung's smartphone offerings in the United States, with 21.4% share and 37.8% in that market, respectively.",
      "iOS grew 3.5% to a 37.8%, while Android slid 1.3% to fall to a 52.3% share.The continued top popularity of the iPhone despite growing Android competition was also attributed to Apple being able to deliver iOS updates over the air, while Android updates are frequently impeded by carrier testing requirements and hardware tailoring, forcing consumers to purchase a new Android smartphone to get the latest version of that OS.",
      "However, by 2013, Apple's market share had fallen to 13.1%, due to the surging popularity of the Android offerings.Apple announced on September 1, 2013, that its iPhone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the US.",
      "For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date.",
      "A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores.On September 20, 2013, the sales date of the iPhone 5S and 5C models, the longest ever queue was observed at the New York City flagship Apple store, in addition to prominent queues in San Francisco, US and Canada; however, locations throughout the world were identified for the anticipation of corresponding consumers.",
      "Apple also increased production of the gold-colored iPhone 5S by an additional one-third due to the particularly strong demand that emerged.",
      "Apple had decided to introduce a gold model after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.Apple released its opening weekend sales results for the 5C and 5S models, showing an all-time high for the product's sales figures, with nine million handsets sold—the previous record was set in 2012, when five million handsets were sold during the opening weekend of the 5 model.",
      "This was the first time that Apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of China in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result.",
      "Apple also announced that, as of September 23, 2013, 200 million devices were running the iOS 7 update, making it the \"fastest software upgrade in history.",
      "\"An Apple Store located at the Christiana Mall in Newark, Delaware, US claimed the highest iPhones sales figures in November 2013.",
      "The store's high sales results are due to the absence of a sales tax in the state of Delaware.The finalization of a deal between Apple and China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network, was announced in late December 2013.",
      "The multi-year agreement provides iPhone access to over 760 million China Mobile subscribers.In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 51 million iPhones, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 47.8 million in the year-ago quarter.",
      "=== iPhone Upgrade Program ===\nThe iPhone Upgrade Program is a 24-month program designed for consumers to be able to get the latest iPhone every year, without paying the whole price up-front.",
      "The program consists of \"low monthly payments\", where consumers will gradually pay for the iPhone they have over a 24-month period, with an opportunity to switch (upgrade) to the new iPhone after 12 months of payment have passed.",
      "Once 12 months have passed, consumers can trade their current iPhone with a new one, and the payments are transferred from the old device to the new device, and the program \"restarts\" with a new 24-month period.Additional features of the program include unlocked handsets, which means consumers are free to pick the network carrier they want, and two-year AppleCare+ protection, which includes \"hardware repairs, software support, and coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage\".Criticism of the program includes the potential endless cycle of payments, with The Huffington Post's Damon Beres writing, \"Complete the full 24-month payment cycle, and you're stuck with an outdated phone.",
      "Upgrade every 12 months, and you'll never stop owing Apple money for iPhones\".",
      "Additionally, the program is limited to just the iPhone hardware; cell phone service from a network operator is not included.",
      "=== Legacy ===\nBefore the release of the iPhone, handset manufacturers such as Nokia and Motorola were enjoying record sales of cell phones based more on fashion and brand rather than technological innovation.",
      "The smartphone market, dominated at the time by BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile devices, was a \"staid, corporate-led smartphone paradigm\" focused on enterprise needs.",
      "Phones at the time were designed around carrier and business limits which were conservative with regards to bandwidth usage and battery life.",
      "Phones were sold in a very large number of models, often segmented by marketing strategy, confusing customers and sapping engineering resources.",
      "For example, phones marketed at business were often deliberately stripped of cameras or the ability to play music and games.",
      "Apple's approach was to deliberately simplify its product line by offering just one model a year for all customers, while making it an expensive, high-end product.",
      "Apple's marketing, developing from the success of iPod campaigns, allowed the phone to become a mass-market product with many buyers on launch day.",
      "Some market research has found that, unusually for a technology product, iPhone users are disproportionately female.",
      "Ars Technica noted in 2012 that Apple had avoided 'patronizing' marketing to female customers, a practice used (often to sell low-quality, high-priced products) by many of its competitors.When then-CEO of Research in Motion Mike Lazaridis pried open an iPhone, his impression was of a Mac stuffed into a cellphone, as it used much more memory and processing power than the smartphones on the market at the time.",
      "With its capacitive touchscreen and consumer-friendly design, the iPhone fundamentally changed the mobile industry, with Steve Jobs proclaiming in 2007, that the phone was not just a communication tool but a way of life.The dominant mobile operating systems at the time such as Symbian, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Mobile were not designed to handle additional tasks beyond communication and basic functions.",
      "These operating systems never focused on applications and developers, and due to infighting among manufacturers as well as the complexity of developing on their low-memory hardware, they never developed a thriving ecosystem like Apple's App Store or Android's Google Play.",
      "iPhone OS (renamed iOS in 2010) was designed as a robust OS with capabilities such as multitasking and graphics in order to meet future consumer demands.",
      "Many services were provided by mobile carriers, who often extensively customized devices.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple's decision to base its OS on OS X had the unexpected benefit of allowing OS X developers to rapidly expand into iOS development.",
      "Rival manufacturers have been forced to spend more on software and development costs to catch up to the iPhone.",
      "The iPhone's success has led to a decline in sales of high-end fashion phones and business-oriented smartphones such as Vertu and BlackBerry, as well as Nokia.",
      "Nokia realised the limitations of its operating system Symbian and attempted to develop a more advanced system, Maemo, without success.",
      "It ultimately agreed to a technology-sharing deal and then a takeover from Microsoft.Prior to the iPhone, \"Handsets were viewed largely as cheap, disposable lures, massively subsidized to snare subscribers and lock them into using the carriers' proprietary services.\"",
      "However, according to Wired, \"Apple retained complete control over the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the iPhone\", meaning that it and not the carrier would control the software updates, and by extension security patches.",
      "By contrast, Google has allowed carriers and OEMs to dictate the \"pace of upgrades and pre-load phones with their own software on top of Android\".",
      "As a result, many Android OEMs often lag months behind Google's release of the next iteration of Android; although Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed two years of operating system updates and a third addition year for security.",
      "However, Apple has supported older iterations of iPhones for over four years.In December 2017, there were reports that Apple has been using a policy of slowing down the speed of its older iPhones when issuing operating system upgrades.",
      "It has spurred allegations that the firm has been using this as a tactic to prompt users of older iPhones to buy newer models.",
      "== Production ==\nUp to the iPhone 4, all iPhone models, as well as other iOS devices were manufactured exclusively by Foxconn, based in Taiwan.",
      "In 2011, after Tim Cook became CEO of the company, Apple changed its outsourcing strategy, for the first time increasing its supply partners.",
      "The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model which was manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn as well as Pegatron, also based in Taiwan.",
      "Although Foxconn is still responsible for the larger share of production, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased, with the company being tasked with producing a part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, and 30% of the iPhone 6 devices in 2014.",
      "The 6 Plus model is being produced solely by Foxconn.",
      "== Hardware ==\n\n\n=== Screen and input ===\nThe touchscreen on the first five generations is a 9 cm (3.5 in) liquid crystal display with scratch-resistant glass, while the one on the iPhone 5 is four inches.",
      "The capacitive touchscreen is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing.",
      "The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320×480 (HVGA) at 163 ppi; those on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have a resolution of 640×960 at 326 ppi; the 4-inch models, with 640×1136 at 326 ppi; the 4.7-inch models, with 750×1334 at 326 ppi; the 5.5-inch models, with 1080×1920 at 401 ppi; and the 5.8-inch model X, with 1125×2436 at 458 ppi.",
      "The initial models were using twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs.",
      "Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs.",
      "The iPhone 5 model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9.",
      "The iPhone X is the first iPhone to use an OLED display.",
      "It has a near bezel-less screen with a ≈19.5:9 aspect ratio.",
      "The touch and gesture features of the iPhone are based on technology originally developed by FingerWorks.",
      "Most gloves and styli prevent the necessary electrical conductivity; although capacitive styli can be used with iPhone's finger-touch screen.",
      "The iPhone 3GS and later also feature a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.",
      "The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, with most models featuring five buttons.",
      "The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the \"Home button\" because its primary function is to close the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface.",
      "Earlier models included a rounded square, reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen, however, new models which include Apple's fingerprint recognition feature Touch ID (which use the Home button as the fingerprint sensor) have no symbol.",
      "The iPhone X doesn't have a Home button but instead Face ID, a facial recognition authentication method.A multi-function sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device.",
      "It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls phone calls.",
      "When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail.",
      "Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls.",
      "The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.",
      "Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections.",
      "This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.",
      "All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original first generation iPhone and metal on all later models.",
      "The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the user interface.",
      "A software update in January 2008 allowed the first-generation iPhone to use cell tower and Wi-Fi network locations trilateration, despite lacking GPS hardware.",
      "Since the iPhone 3G generation, the iPhone employs A-GPS operated by the United States.",
      "Since the iPhone 4S generation the device also supports the GLONASS global positioning system, which is operated by Russia.",
      "The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, introduced in 2015, feature 3D Touch displays which allows the screen to recognize how hard it is being pressed using pressure sensitive multi-touch technology.",
      "All subsequent iPhones with the exception of the iPhone SE and iPhone XR have this feature.",
      "An example of how this technology will be used is lightly pressing the screen to preview a photograph and pressing down to take it.",
      "=== Sensors ===\niPhones feature a number of sensors, which are used to adjust the screen based on operating conditions, enable motion-controlled games, location-based services, unlock the phone, and authenticate purchases with Apple Pay, among many other things.",
      "==== Proximity sensor ====\nA proximity sensor deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call.",
      "This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears.",
      "==== Ambient light sensor ====\nAn ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness which saves battery power and prevents the screen from being too bright or too dark.",
      "==== Accelerometer ====\nA 3-axis accelerometer senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode.",
      "Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations.",
      "Unlike the iPad, the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home button above the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so.",
      "The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input (generally for undo functionality).",
      "The accelerometer can also be used to control third-party apps, notably games.",
      "It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a pedometer.",
      "Starting with the iPhone 5S, this functionality was included in the M7 Motion coprocessor and subsequent revisions of the embedded chip.",
      "==== Magnetometer ====\nA magnetometer is built-in since the iPhone 3GS, which is used to measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device.",
      "Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re-calibrate by moving the device in a figure-eight motion.",
      "Since the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone also features a Compass app, which was unique at time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field.",
      "==== Gyroscopic sensor ====\nBeginning with the iPhone 4, Apple's smartphones also include a gyroscopic sensor, enhancing its perception of how it is moved.",
      "==== Radio ====\nSome previous iPhone models contained a chip capable of receiving radio signals; however, Apple has the FM radio feature switched off because there was no antenna connected to the chip.",
      "Later iterations of the iPhone (starting with the iPhone 7), however, do not contain radio chips at all.",
      "A campaign called \"Free Radio On My Phone\" was started to encourage cellphone manufacturers such as Apple to enable the radio on the phones they manufacture, reasons cited were that radio drains less power and is useful in an emergency such as the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire.",
      "==== Fingerprint sensor ====\nUntil 2017, iPhone models starting from iPhone 5S (excluding the iPhone 5C) featured Apple's fingerprint recognition sensor.",
      "It is used for unlocking the device and authenticating Apple Pay purchases (since the iPhone 6) using Touch ID.",
      "It is located in the home button.",
      "Touch ID has been replaced by Face ID, starting with the iPhone X.",
      "==== Barometer ====\nIncluded on the iPhone 6 and later (excluding the iPhone SE), a barometer used to determine air pressure, and elevation from the device.",
      "==== Facial recognition sensor ====\nThe iPhone X features a facial recognition sensor, named the TrueDepth camera system.",
      "It is used for unlocking the device and for authenticating purchases using Face ID.",
      "It can also be used for Animojis and AR.",
      "=== Audio and output ===\n\nOn the bottom of the iPhone, there is a speaker to the left of the dock connector and a microphone to the right.",
      "There is an additional loudspeaker above the screen that serves as an earpiece during phone calls.",
      "The iPhone 4 includes an additional microphone at the top of the unit for noise cancellation, and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unit—the speaker is on the right.",
      "Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.",
      "The 3.5mm TRRS connector for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device for the first five generations (original through 4S), after which time it was moved to the bottom left corner.",
      "The headphone socket on the first-generation iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter.",
      "Subsequent generations eliminated the problem by using a flush-mounted headphone socket.",
      "Cars equipped with an auxiliary jack allow handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for Bluetooth.",
      "The iPhone 7 and later have no 3.5mm headphone jack, and instead headsets must connect to the iPhone by Bluetooth, use Apple's Lightning port (which has replaced the 3.5mm headphone jack), or (for traditional headsets) use the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, which is included with all iPhone 7 and later units, and plugs into the Lightning port.",
      "Apple's own headset has a multipurpose button near the microphone that can play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone.",
      "Some third-party headsets designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button.",
      "The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models.",
      "A fourth ring in the audio jack carries this extra information.",
      "The built-in Bluetooth 2.x+EDR supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the HSP profile.",
      "Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports A2DP.",
      "While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the OBEX file transfer protocol.",
      "The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other Bluetooth-enabled cell phones.",
      "Composite or component video at up to 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple.",
      "iPhone 4 also supports 1024×768 VGA output without audio, and HDMI output, with stereo audio, via dock adapters.",
      "The iPhone did not support voice recording until the 3.0 software update.",
      "=== Battery ===\n\nThe iPhone features an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery.",
      "Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones at the time of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable.",
      "The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to charging an iPod.",
      "Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or \"wall charger\", also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an AC outlet.",
      "Some models of the iPhone support wireless charging.Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life.",
      "Apple's website says that the battery life \"is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles\", which is comparable to iPod batteries.",
      "The battery life of early models of the iPhone has been criticized by several technology journalists as insufficient and less than Apple's claims.",
      "This is also reflected by a J. D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey, which gave the \"battery aspects\" of the iPhone 3G its lowest rating of two out of five stars.If the battery malfunctions or dies prematurely, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still under warranty.",
      "The warranty lasts one year from purchase and can be extended to two years with AppleCare.",
      "The battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched; it is similar to how Apple (and third parties) replace batteries for iPods.",
      "The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a consumer advocate group, has sent a complaint to Apple and AT&T over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced.",
      "Apple reduced the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement to $29.Since July 2007, third-party battery replacement kits have been available at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program.",
      "These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the first generation iPhone has been soldered in.",
      "Therefore, a soldering iron is required to install the new battery.",
      "The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace.",
      "The iPhone X features a different battery, with two battery cells, and the adhesive pull tabs are adhered to the sides instead of folded over the top, therefore making repairs a little more difficult than before.A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly.",
      "Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.",
      "==== Controversy ====\nOn December 28, 2017, amidst many complaints about older iPhone models slowing down when new ones are released, Apple released a communication to its customers on its website, acknowledging the effect that old batteries have on the iPhone's performance.",
      "The company offered $29 battery replacements as a solution.",
      "=== Camera ===\nThe first-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G have a fixed-focus 2.0-megapixel camera on the back for digital photos.",
      "It has no optical zoom, flash or autofocus, and does not natively support video recording.",
      "Video recording is possible on the first-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G via a third-party app available on the App Store or through jailbreaking.",
      "iPhone OS 2.0 introduced geotagging for photos.",
      "The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10 cm).",
      "Manufactured by OmniVision, the camera can also capture 640×480 (VGA resolution) video at 30 frames per second.",
      "The video can be cropped on the iPhone and directly uploaded to YouTube or other services.",
      "The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0-megapixel camera (2592×1936 pixels) that can record video at 720p resolution, considered high-definition.",
      "It also has a backside-illuminated sensor that can capture pictures in low light and an LED flash that can stay lit while recording video.",
      "It is the first iPhone that can natively do high dynamic range photography.",
      "The iPhone 4 also has a second camera on the front that can take VGA photos and record SD video.",
      "Saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by MMS.",
      "The iPhone 4S' camera can shoot 8-MP stills and 1080p video, can be accessed directly from the lock screen, and can be triggered using the volume-up button as a shutter trigger.",
      "The built-in gyroscope can stabilize the image while recording video.",
      "The iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S, running iOS 6 or later, can take panoramas using the built-in camera app, and the iPhone 5 can also take still photos while recording video.The camera on the iPhone 5 reportedly shows purple haze when the light source is just out of frame, although Consumer Reports said it \"is no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several Android phones with fine cameras...\"On all five model generations, the phone can be configured to bring up the camera app by quickly pressing the home key twice.",
      "On all iPhones running iOS 5, it can also be accessed from the lock screen directly.",
      "The iPhone 5S features True Tone Flash, which has two LED lights, white and amber, that will improve white balance and will be adjusted in 1,000 combinations.",
      "The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include phase detection autofocus, while the 6 Plus has Optical Image Stabilization.",
      "Both models can shoot 1080p videos at 60 frames per second.",

      "The front-facing camera is upgraded to 5 megapixels.",
      "The user may change the resolution between 4K and 1080p in Settings.",
      "The iPhone 7 features optical image stabilization on its rear camera, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Plus models, and the 7 Plus is the first iPhone to feature dual-lens cameras (both 12 MP).",
      "Both models have a 7 MP front-facing camera.",
      "The second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a telephoto lens, which enables 2× optical zoom and up to 10× digital zoom.",
      "The rear cameras on the 7 and 7 Plus both have a f/1.8 aperture.",
      "It also has a new quad-LED True Tone flash, which is brighter compared to its predecessors.",
      "The iPhone 8 camera remains largely the same as its predecessor, but it features a larger sensor, and a newer color filter.",
      "The camera can also now record 4K at 60 and 24 frames per second, and slow-mo at 1080p in 240 frames per second.",
      "The new camera system also enables Portrait Lighting, which defines the light in a scene.",
      "It also features a quad-LED True Tone flash with 2× better light uniformity and Slow Sync.The iPhone X camera is almost the same as the iPhone 8's camera, but the telephoto lens has an aperture of f/2.4 and optical image stabilization.",
      "The front camera also has Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting, due to the new TrueDepth camera system.The iPhone XS, XS Max and XR have a updated 12MP (1/2.55\") sensor size with a 1.4 μm pixel size.",
      "The XS series has telephoto lens, while the lower end XR has only one lens.",
      "=== Storage ===\nThe iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4 or 8 GB.",
      "On September 5, 2007, Apple discontinued the 4 GB models.On February 5, 2008, Apple added a 16 GB model.",
      "The iPhone 3G was available in 8 and 16 GB.",
      "The iPhone 3GS came in 16 and 32 GB variants and remained available in 8 GB until September 2012, more than three years after its launch.",
      "The iPhone 4 was available in 16 and 32 GB variants, as well as an 8 GB variant to be sold alongside the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point.",
      "The iPhone 4S was available in three sizes: 16, 32, and 64 GB.",
      "The iPhone 5 and 5S were available in the same three sizes previously available to the iPhone 4S: 16, 32, and 64 GB.",
      "The lower-cost iPhone 5C model was initially available in 16 and 32 GB models; an 8 GB model was added later.",
      "The iPhone 6 and 6S were available in three sizes at launch: 16, 64, and 128 GB.",
      "The iPhone SE was available in 16 and 64 GB variants at launch.",
      "When the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released, Apple changed the base model storage capacity from 16 to 32 GB.",
      "Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have configurations of 32, 128, and 256 GB storage.",
      "Apple doubled the storage on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in two configurations (32 and 128 GB), as well as the iPhone SE six months later.",
      "The iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X have 64 or 256 GB of storage.",
      "The iPhone XS and XS Max introduced a 512GB storage option, in addition to the existing 64 and 256 GB options.",
      "=== SIM card ===\n\nGSM models of the iPhone use a SIM card to identify themselves to the GSM network.",
      "The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device.",
      "The SIM tray can be ejected with a paper clip or the \"SIM ejector tool\" (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS in the United States and with all models elsewhere in the world.",
      "Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed \"Liquidmetal\".",
      "In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a SIM lock, which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network.The GSM iPhone 4 features a MicroSIM card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.The CDMA model of the iPhone 4, just the same as any other CDMA-only cell phone, does not use a SIM card or have a SIM card slot.",
      "An iPhone 4S activated on a CDMA carrier, however, does have a SIM card slot but does not rely on a SIM card for activation on that CDMA network.",
      "A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only.",
      "The SIM slot is locked to only use the roaming SIM card provided by the CDMA carrier.In the case of Verizon, for example, one can request that the SIM slot be unlocked for international use by calling their support number and requesting an international unlock if their account has been in good standing for the past 60 days.",
      "This method only unlocks the iPhone 4S for use on international carriers.",
      "An iPhone 4S that has been unlocked in this way will reject any non international SIM cards (AT&T Mobility or T-Mobile USA, for example).",
      "The iPhone 5 and later iPhones use nano-SIM in order to save space internally.",
      "=== Liquid contact indicators ===\nAll iPhones (as well as many other devices by Apple) have a small disc at the bottom of the headphone jack that changes from white to red on contact with water; the iPhone 3G and later models also have a similar indicator at the bottom of the dock connector.",
      "Because Apple warranties do not cover water damage, employees examine the indicators before approving warranty repair or replacement.",
      "However, with the adoption of water resistance as a feature of the iPhone, this practice is no longer in use by Apple.",
      "The iPhone's indicators are more exposed than those in some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover.",
      "These indicators can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat, steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture.",
      "Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.",
      "=== Included items ===\n\nAll iPhone models include written documentation, and a dock connector to USB cable.",
      "The first generation and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth.",
      "The first generation iPhone includes a stereo headset (earbuds and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing.",
      "The iPhone 3G includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the first generation model requires a paperclip).",
      "The iPhone 3GS includes the SIM eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions).The iPhone 3G and 3GS are compatible with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock.",
      "All versions include a USB power adapter, or \"wall charger\", which allows the iPhone to charge from an AC outlet.",
      "The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS sold in North America, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru include an ultracompact USB power adapter.",
      "=== Payments ===\n\nIn September 2014, with the launch of the iPhone 6, Apple announced Apple Pay, a mobile payment system.",
      "The feature, aimed to \"revolutionize\" the way users pay, uses an NFC chip, Touch ID fingerprint scanner (Face ID on iPhone X and later), Apple's Wallet app, and a dedicated \"Secure Element\" chip for encrypted payment information to make purchases at participating stores, both physical and online.",
      "=== Taptic Engine ===\nAll iPhone models have a haptic engine to vibrate when a notification or alert, incoming call, etc.",
      "iPhone models before iPhone 4S use eccentric rotating mass motor.",
      "The iPhone 4S uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator, which usually uses less power and creates a quieter vibration.",
      "However, the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S uses an eccentric rotating mass motor.",
      "It is unsure as to why Apple decided to switch back.",
      "However, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator.",
      "iPhone 6S and after uses taptic engine for vibration and haptic feedback, which works similar to the eccentric rotating mass motor.",
      "== Software ==\n\nThe iPhone runs an operating system known as iOS (formerly iPhone OS).",
      "It is a variant of the Darwin operating system core found in macOS.",
      "Also included is the \"Core Animation\" software component from Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard.",
      "Together with the graphics hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS, OpenGL ES 2.0), it is responsible for the interface's motion graphics.",
      "The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple, and supports downloading third-party applications through the App Store.Apple provides free updates to the operating system for the iPhone either wirelessly or through iTunes.",
      "Major new updates have historically accompanied new models.The size of the operating system depends on version.",
      "While iOS 8 required over 4.5 GB, its successor required only 1.3 GB.",
      "=== Interface ===\nThe interface is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications.",
      "iPhone applications normally run one at a time.",
      "Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play.",
      "Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.",
      "However, the apps never ran in the background.",
      "Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music.",
      "The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier.",
      "iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.",
      "The original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages (SMS and MMS messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps (Google Maps), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and iTunes (store).",
      "The App Store was introduced for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4.",
      "Compass, FaceTime and GameCenter were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively.",
      "In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications.",
      "iOS 6 added Passbook as well as an updated version of Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources.",
      "YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application.",
      "Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for Phone, Mail, Safari (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.",
      "On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari.",
      "After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen.",
      "Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the first-generation iPhone, 3G, 4 and 4S, while each home screen for iPhone 5 holds up to twenty-four icons due to a larger screen display, and the dock holds up to four icons.",
      "Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes.",
      "Apple's default programs, could only be removed since the iOS 10 update.",
      "The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as Spotlight, to the left of the first home screen.Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch.",
      "The iPhone's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger.",
      "For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"pinching\".",
      "Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back.",
      "In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction.",
      "In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.",
      "Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes upwards, as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side.",
      "Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary.",
      "Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif.",
      "In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.",
      "=== Phone ===\n\nThe iPhone allows audio conferencing, call holding, call merging, caller ID, and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions.",
      "For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended.",
      "The proximity sensor shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches.",
      "The iPhone does not support video calling or videoconferencing on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls FaceTime.",
      "Voice control, introduced in the iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it.",
      "The first two models only support voice dialing through third-party applications.The iPhone includes a visual voicemail (in some countries) feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail.",
      "Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.",
      "A music ringtone feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007.",
      "Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee.",
      "The ringtones can be three to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or loop continuously.",
      "All customizing can be done in iTunes, or with Apple's GarageBand software 4.1.1 or later (available only on Mac OS X) or third-party tools.With the release of iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012, Apple added features that enable the user to have options to decline a phone call when a person is calling them.",
      "The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.",
      "=== Multimedia ===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to that of an iPod.",
      "The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations.",
      "Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.",
      "The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.",
      "Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow.",
      "Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library.",
      "Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen.",
      "Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.",
      "On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.The iPhone supports gapless playback.",
      "Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen.",
      "Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.",
      "The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone.",
      "The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but since 2012, it can be used on a cellular data network.The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera.",
      "The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari.",
      "The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera.",
      "Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.",
      "=== Internet connectivity ===\n\nInternet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area Wi-Fi or a wide area GSM or EDGE network, both second-generation (2G) wireless data standards.",
      "The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation UMTS and HSDPA 3.6, the iPhone 4S introduced support for HSUPA networks (14.4 Mbit/s), and support for HSDPA 7.2 was introduced in the iPhone 3GS.",
      "Networks accessible from iPhone models include 1xRTT (represented by a 1× on the status bar) and GPRS (shown as GPRS on the status bar), EDGE (shown as a capital E on the status bar), UMTS and EV-DO (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown as a 4G symbol on the status bar), and LTE (shown as LTE on the status bar).AT&T introduced 3G in July 2004, but as late as 2007, Steve Jobs stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone.",
      "Support for 802.1X, an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update.By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered Wi-Fi networks and prompt for the password when required.",
      "Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.",
      "The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.",
      "Similarly, the iPhone 3G and onwards prefer 3G to 2G, and Wi-Fi to either.Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 3G (on the iPhone 3G onwards) can all be deactivated individually.",
      "Airplane mode disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences.",
      "However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.",
      "Safari is the iPhone's native web browser, and it displays pages similar to its Mac and Windows counterparts.",
      "Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.",
      "Safari does not allow file downloads except for predefined extensions.",
      "The iPhone does not support Flash, which was still popular when the iPhone was introduced.",
      "Consequently, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access \"all parts of the internet\" should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of false advertising.",
      "In a rare public letter in April 2010, Apple CEO Steve Jobs outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and iPad).",
      "The iPhone supports SVG, CSS, HTML Canvas, and Bonjour.",
      "Google Chrome was introduced to the iOS on June 26, 2012, and Opera mini is also available.",
      "The Maps application can access Google Maps in map, satellite, or hybrid form.",
      "It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information.",
      "During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby Starbucks locations and then placing a prank call to one with a single tap.",
      "Support for walking directions, public transit, and street view was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass.",
      "Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the H.264 codec.",
      "Simple weather and stock quotes applications also tap into the Internet.",
      "iPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places.",
      "According to Google, in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.",
      "According to Deutsche Telekom CEO René Obermann, \"The average Internet usage for an iPhone customer is more than 100 megabytes.",
      "This is 30 times the use for our average contract-based consumer customers.\"",
      "Nielsen found that 98% of iPhone users use data services, and 88% use the internet.",
      "In China, the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS were built and distributed without Wi-Fi.With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone was brought to the public's attention.",
      "Under the two US carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on AT&T networks, whereas Verizon networks only support the use of each separately.However, in 2014, Verizon announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would allow simultaneous voice and data over its LTE Network.",
      "T-Mobile and Sprint have enabled calls over Wi-Fi, with Verizon and AT&T soon doing the same.",
      "=== Text input ===\n\nFor text input, the iPhone implements a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen.",
      "It has automatic spell checking and correction, predictive word capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words.",
      "The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in landscape mode, which is supported by only a limited number of applications.",
      "Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a magnifying glass, allowing users to place the cursor in the middle of existing text.",
      "The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.Alternative characters with accents (for example, letters from the alphabets of other languages) and emoji can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for two seconds and selecting the alternative character from the popup.",
      "The 3.0 update brought support for cut, copy, or pasting text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.",
      "On iPhone 4S and above, Siri allows dictation.",
      "Since iOS 8, third party keyboards, distributed through the App Store, are allowed.",
      "Previously, they were only available on jailbroken iPhones.",
      "=== Email and text messages ===\nThe iPhone also features an email program that supports HTML email, which enables the user to embed photos in an email message.",
      "PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.",
      "Yahoo!",
      "offers a free push-email service for the iPhone.",
      "IMAP (although not Push-IMAP) and POP3 mail standards are also supported, including Microsoft Exchange and Kerio Connect.In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server.",
      "Apple has also licensed Microsoft ActiveSync and supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware.",
      "The iPhone will sync email account settings over from Apple's own Mail application, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Entourage, or it can be manually configured on the device itself.",
      "The email program can access almost any IMAP or POP3 account.Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies.",
      "Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to iChat) under each recipient's name.",
      "The iPhone has built-in support for email message forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending.",
      "Support for multi-recipient SMS was added in the 1.1.3 software update.",
      "Support for MMS was added in the 3.0 update, but not for the original first generation iPhone and not in the US until September 25, 2009.",
      "=== Third-party applications ===\n\nAt WWDC 2007 on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support third-party web applications using Ajax that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.",
      "On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's \"Hot News\" weblog, announced that a software development kit (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008.",
      "The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an \"iPhone simulator\".",
      "However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an Apple Developer Connection membership fee.",
      "Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the App Store, of which they will receive a 70% share.Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee.",
      "The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.",
      "The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution.",
      "Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example, I Am Rich, a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user.",
      "Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected Podcaster, which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes.",
      "Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability.NetShare, another rejected app, would have enabled users to tether their iPhone to a laptop or desktop, using its cellular network to load data for the computer.",
      "Many carriers of the iPhone later globally allowed tethering before Apple officially supported it with the upgrade to the iOS 3.0, with AT&T Mobility being a relative latecomer in the United States.",
      "In most cases, the carrier charges extra for tethering an iPhone.",
      "Before the SDK was released, third parties were permitted to design \"Web Apps\" that would run through Safari.",
      "Unsigned native applications are also available for \"jailbroken\" phones.",
      "The ability to install native applications onto the iPhone outside of the App Store is not supported by Apple, the stated reason being that such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than those that perform SIM unlocking.As of October 2013, Apple has passed 60 billion app downloads.",
      "As of September 2016, there have been over 140 billion app downloads from the App Store.As of January 2017, the App Store has over 2.2 million apps for the iPhone.",
      "== Reception ==\nThe original iPhone has been described as \"revolutionary\", a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011.",
      "Newer iterations have also received praise, such as being called \"the best phone\".The iPhone attracts users of all ages, and besides consumer use, the iPhone has also been adopted for business purposes.",
      "== Accessibility features ==\nStarting with the iPhone 4S, Apple added an accessibility feature to optimize the function of the iPhone with hearing aids.",
      "Apple released a program of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.",
      "These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience and allow the user to manage the hearing aid right from the iPhone.",
      "Made for iPhone hearing aids also feature Live Listen.",
      "With Live Listen the iPhone acts as a remote microphone that sends sound to a Made for iPhone hearing aid.",
      "Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.The Braille Displays for iOS program was announced by Apple coinciding with the release of the iPhone 3GS, iPad and iPod Touch (3rd Generation).",
      "This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless braille displays that work with iOS out of the box.",
      "The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with VoiceOver without any additional software.",
      "iOS supports braille tables for more than 25 languages.iPhone lets the user know when an alert is sent to the it, in a variety of notice methods.",
      "It delivers both visual and vibrating alerts for incoming phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events.",
      "Users can set an LED light flash for incoming calls and alerts or have incoming calls display a photo of the caller.",
      "Users can choose from different vibration patterns or even create their own.The iPhone can enlarge text to make it more accessible for vision-impaired users, and can accommodate hearing-impaired users with closed captioning and external TTY devices.",
      "The iPhone 3GS also features white on black mode, VoiceOver (a screen reader), and zooming for impaired vision, and mono audio for limited hearing in one ear.",
      "Apple regularly publishes Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates which explicitly state compliance with the US regulation \"Section 508\".With the release of iOS 9 for all iPhones, users have the ability to choose between two different screen view options.",
      "The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view.",
      "When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same.",
      "With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger.",
      "This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.",
      "AssistiveTouch helps to adapt the Multi-Touch screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs.",
      "This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger.",
      "The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu.",
      "If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap.",
      "Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair.Guided Access helps people with autism or other attention and sensory challenges stay focused on the task (or app) at hand.",
      "With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button, and limit the amount of time spent in an app.",
      "The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.",
      "== Models ==\n\n21 different iPhone models have been produced.",
      "The models in bold are current flagship devices:\n\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nApple has filed more than 200 patent applications related to the technology behind the iPhone.LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the LG Prada.",
      "Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&D Center, said at a press conference: \"we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.\"",
      "Conversely, the iPhone has also inspired its own share of high-tech clones.On September 3, 1993, Infogear filed for the US trademark \"I PHONE\" and on March 20, 1996, applied for the trademark \"IPhone\".",
      "\"I Phone\" was registered in March 1998, and \"IPhone\" was registered in 1999.",
      "Since then, the I PHONE mark had been abandoned.",
      "Infogear trademarks cover \"communications terminals comprising computer hardware and software providing integrated telephone, data communications and personal computer functions\" (1993 filing), and \"computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks\" (1996 filing).In 2000, Infogear filed an infringement claim against the owners of the iPhones.com domain name.",
      "The owners of the iPhones.com domain name challenged the infringement claim in the Northern District Court of California.",
      "In June 2000, Cisco Systems acquired Infogear, including the iPhone trademark.",
      "In September 2000, Cisco Systems settled with the owners of iPhones.com and allowed the owners to keep the iPhones.com domain name along with intellectual property rights to use any designation of the iPhones.com domain name for the sale of cellular phones, cellular phones with Internet access (WAP PHONES), handheld PDAs, storage devices, computer equipment (hardware/software), and digital cameras (hardware/software).",
      "The intellectual property rights were granted to the owners of the iPhones.com domain name by Cisco Systems in September 2000.",
      "In October 2002, Apple applied for the \"iPhone\" trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union.",
      "A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006.",
      "As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted.",
      "In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an \"iPhone\" trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.",
      "The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called Comwave who themselves applied for the trademark three months later.",
      "Comwave has been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004.Shortly after Steve Jobs' January 9, 2007 announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before.",
      "On January 10, 2007, Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name.",
      "In February 2007, Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a \"minor skirmish\" that was not about money, but about interoperability.On February 2, 2007, Apple and Cisco announced that they had agreed to temporarily suspend litigation while they held settlement talks, and subsequently announced on February 20, 2007, that they had reached an agreement.",
      "Both companies will be allowed to use the \"iPhone\" name in exchange for \"exploring interoperability\" between their security, consumer, and business communications products.On October 22, 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple for infringement of its GSM, UMTS and WLAN patents.",
      "Nokia alleges that Apple has been violating ten Nokia patents since the iPhone initial release.In December 2010, Reuters reported that some iPhone and iPad users were suing Apple Inc. because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission.",
      "Some makers of the applications such as Textplus4, Paper Toss, The Weather Channel, Dictionary.com, Talking Tom Cat and Pumpkin Maker have also been named as co-defendants in the lawsuit.In August 2012, Apple won a smartphone patent lawsuit in the U.S. against Samsung, the world's largest maker of smartphones; however, on December 6, 2016, SCOTUS reversed the decision that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard to define \"article of manufacture\" because it is not the smartphone itself but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate.In March 2013, an Apple patent for a wraparound display was revealed.",
      "== Location tracking controversies ==\nAround April 20, 2011, a hidden unencrypted file on the iPhone and other iOS devices was widely discussed in the media.",
      "It was alleged that the file, labeled \"consolidated.db\", constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers, a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.",
      "The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple iOS4 and may contain almost a year's worth of data.",
      "Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called \"h-cells.plist\".F-Secure discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and Skyhook through wardriving.",
      "Nevertheless, unlike the Google \"Latitude\" application, which performs a similar task on Android phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific EULA or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long terms and conditions of the iPhone that \"Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device\".The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone.",
      "An open-source application named \"iPhoneTracker\", which turns the data stored in the file into a visual map, was made available to the public in April 2011.",
      "While the file cannot be erased without jailbreaking the phone, it can be encrypted.Apple gave an official response on their web site on April 27, 2011, after questions were submitted by users, the Associated Press and others.",
      "Apple clarified that the data is a small portion of their crowd-sourced location database cache of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone for making location services faster than with only GPS, therefore the data does not represent the locations of the iPhone.",
      "The volume of data retained was an error.",
      "Apple issued an update for iOS (version 4.3.3, or 4.2.8 for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off.",
      "The upload to Apple can also be selectively disabled from \"System services\", \"Cell Network Search.\"",
      "Regardless, in July 2014, a report on state-owned China Central Television labeled the iPhone a \"national security concern.",
      "\"The \"Frequent Locations\" feature found in \"Settings\" under \"Location Services\" stores commonly visited locations locally on the device.",
      "This feature is said to help the accuracy of the GPS and Apple Maps since it can log information about the locations the user has frequently visited.",
      "However, this feature also keeps track of the number of times that the user has been to that location, the dates, and the exact times.",
      "Media outlets have publicized instructions on how this can be disabled for concerned users.",
      "== Encryption and intelligence agency access ==\nIt was revealed as a part of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have access to the user data in iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android phones, respectively.",
      "They can read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.According to an article in The New York Times titled \"Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A.",

      "== Restrictions ==\n\nApple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone.",
      "According to Jonathan Zittrain, the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone have made computing more proprietary than early versions of Microsoft Windows.The hacker community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and make it difficult or impossible to obtain warranty service.",
      "\"Jailbreaking\" allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality.",
      "SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network.",
      "However, in the United States, Apple cannot void an iPhone's warranty unless it can show that a problem or component failure is linked to the installation or placement of an after-market item such as unauthorized applications, because of the Federal Trade Commission's Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975.Users can set restrictions or parental controls on apps that can be downloaded or used within the iPhone.",
      "The restrictions area requires a password.",
      "=== Activation ===\nThe iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier.",
      "On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary.",
      "He published the software and offsets for others to use.Unlike the first generation iPhone, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries.",
      "This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack.",
      "The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and iPod Touch users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide overload of Apple's servers on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as MobileMe were released.",
      "After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate it, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable.Users on the O2 network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model.",
      "Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience.",
      "In the US, Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement.",
      "Best Buy and Walmart will also sell the iPhone.",
      "=== Unapproved third-party software and jailbreaking ===\n\nThe iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved cryptographic signature.",
      "This restriction can be overcome by \"jailbreaking\" the phone, which involves replacing the iPhone's firmware with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check.",
      "Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's technical protection measures.",
      "Apple, in a statement to the United States Copyright Office in response to Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be copyright infringement due to the necessary modification of system software.",
      "However, in 2010, Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the United States by the DMCA.",
      "Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported.iOS and Android 2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a jailbroken iPhone with the help of OpeniBoot or iDroid.In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called JailbreakMe that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering to jailbreak the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps).",
      "Each of these exploits were quickly fixed by iOS updates from Apple.",
      "Theoretically these flaws could have also been used for malicious purposes.In July 2011, Apple released iOS 4.3.5 (4.2.10 for CDMA iPhone) to fix a security vulnerability with certificate validation.Following the release of the iPhone 5S model, a group of German hackers called the Chaos Computer Club announced on September 21, 2013, that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using \"easy everyday means.\"",
      "The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image as verification.",

      "It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.\"",
      "=== SIM unlocking ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nMost iPhones were and are still sold with a SIM lock, which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized GSM phones.",
      "Unlike most GSM phones, however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code.",
      "The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers per IMEI and is set when the iPhone is activated.While the iPhone was initially sold in the US only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to \"unlock\" the phone from a specific network.",
      "Although AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States, unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers.",
      "For example, an unlocked iPhone may be used on the T-Mobile network in the US but, while an unlocked iPhone is compatible with T-Mobile's voice network, it may not be able to make use of 3G functionality (i.e.",
      "no mobile web or e-mail, etc.).",
      "More than a quarter of the original first generation iPhones sold in the US were not registered with AT&T.",
      "Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.On March 26, 2009, AT&T in the United States began selling the iPhone without a contract, though still SIM-locked to their network.",
      "The up-front purchase price of such iPhone units is often twice as expensive as those bundled with contracts.Outside of the United States, policies differ, especially in US territories and insular areas like Guam; GTA Teleguam was the exclusive carrier for the iPhone since its introduction, as none of the four US carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) have a presence in the area.",
      "Since 2013, Docomo Pacific ended GTA's exclusivity starting with the iPhone 5.Beginning April 8, 2012, AT&T began offering a factory SIM unlock option (which Apple calls a \"whitelisting\", allowing it to be used on any carrier the phone supports) for iPhone owners.It has been reported that all of the Verizon 4G LTE phones come factory unlocked.",
      "After such discovery, Verizon announced that all of their 4G LTE phones, including iPhones, would remain unlocked.",
      "This is due to the regulations that the FCC has placed on the 700 MHz C-Block spectrum, which is used by Verizon.",
      "==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the United Kingdom, O2, EE, 3, Vodafone, and Tesco Mobile sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go.",
      "They are locked to the network initially, though they can usually be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee (with the exception of the 3 network, which will unlock the device at any time for no charge).",
      "However, all current versions of iPhone are available for purchase SIM-free from the Apple Store or Apple's Online Store, consequently, they are unlocked for use on any GSM network too.",
      "==== Canada ====\nAll iPhones purchased for full retail price at an Apple Store or online at apple.com come unlocked which allows customer selection of carriers.",
      "iPhones sold in Canada purchased through mobile carries such as TELUS, Rogers, or Bell were locked to their respective networks and unlocking required visiting a carrier store and paying an unlocking fee.",
      "Third party methods to unlock iPhones existed but were highly unreliable and sometimes rendered phones unusable.",

    "content": [
      "Logic (from the Ancient Greek: λογική, translit.",
      "logikḗ) is the systematic study of the form of valid inference, and the most general laws of truth.",
      "A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.",
      "In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as therefore, hence, ergo, and so on.",
      "There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see § Rival conceptions, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of proof and inference, including paradoxes and fallacies, and the study of syntax and semantics.",
      "Historically, logic has been studied in philosophy (since ancient times) and mathematics (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in computer science, linguistics, psychology, and other fields.",
      "== Concepts ==\nThe concept of logical form is central to logic.",
      "The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content.",
      "Traditional Aristotelian syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.",
      "Informal logic is the study of natural language arguments.",
      "The study of fallacies is an important branch of informal logic.",
      "Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.",
      "See § Rival conceptions below.",
      "Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content.",
      "An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property.",
      "The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known formal study of logic.",
      "Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.",
      "In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same.",
      "This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.",
      "Symbolic logic is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.",
      "Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: propositional logic and predicate logic.",
      "Mathematical logic is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of model theory, proof theory, set theory, and computability theory.However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive although the field of universal logic has studied the common structure of logics.",
      "=== Logical form ===\n\nLogic is generally considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type.",
      "The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference.",
      "Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.",
      "This is called showing the logical form of the argument.",
      "It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical.",
      "It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as \"but\") with logical conjunctions like \"and\" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions (\"any\", \"every\", etc.)",
      "with expressions of a standard type (such as \"all\", or the universal quantifier ∀).",
      "Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters.",
      "Thus, for example, the expression \"all Ps are Qs\" shows the logical form common to the sentences \"all men are mortals\", \"all cats are carnivores\", \"all Greeks are philosophers\", and so on.",
      "The schema can further be condensed into the formula A(P,Q), where the letter A indicates the judgement 'all – are –'.",
      "The importance of form was recognised from ancient times.",
      "Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in Prior Analytics, leading Jan Łukasiewicz to say that the introduction of variables was \"one of Aristotle's greatest inventions\".",
      "According to the followers of Aristotle (such as Ammonius), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms.",
      "The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders P, Q, R, which were called the \"matter\" (Greek hyle) of the inference.",
      "There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the predicate calculus that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.",
      "The formula A(P,Q) (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula \n  \n    \n      \n        ∀\n        x\n        (\n        P\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        →\n        Q\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall x(P(x)\\rightarrow Q(x))}\n   in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for universal quantification and implication rather than just the predicate letter A and using variable arguments \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P(x)}\n   where traditional logic uses just the term letter P.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.",
      "=== Semantics ===\n\nThe validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or semantics of the sentences that make it up.",
      "Aristotle's Organon, especially On Interpretation, gives a cursory outline of semantics which the scholastic logicians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called Supposition Theory.",
      "This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or stand for certain extra-linguistic items.",
      "For example, in part II of his Summa Logicae, William of Ockham presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.",
      "Thus \"every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand.",
      "\"Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.",
      "Antoine Arnauld in the Port Royal Logic, says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them.",
      "This is called affirming or denying, and in general judging.",
      "Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.",
      "This suggests obvious difficulties, leading Locke to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.",
      "This view (psychologism) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.",
      "Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.",
      "However, the introduction of quantification, needed to solve the problem of multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.",
      "The main modern approach is model-theoretic semantics, based on Alfred Tarski's semantic theory of truth.",
      "The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined domain of discourse: an interpretation of first-order predicate logic is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of individuals, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values \"true\" and \"false\".",
      "Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of model theory.",
      "Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the proof-theoretic semantics that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of Gerhard Gentzen on structural proof theory and is heavily influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy, especially his aphorism \"meaning is use\".",
      "=== Inference ===\nInference is not to be confused with implication.",
      "An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.",
      "The Stoic logician Philo of Megara was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.",
      "An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.",
      "An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.",
      "However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is true, the inference 'p therefore q' is valid.",
      "This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.",
      "The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as William of Ockham and Walter Burley.",
      "It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's Topics and Boethius' De Syllogismis hypotheticis.",
      "This is why many terms in logic are Latin.",
      "For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as modus ponens (or 'mode of positing').",
      "Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.",
      "The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.",
      "However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called 'hypothetical syllogism' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.",
      "This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.",
      "The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the Encyclopædia Britannica article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H.",
      "Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.",
      "=== Logical systems ===\n\nA formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction.",
      "It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences.",
      "Among the important properties that logical systems can have are:\n\nConsistency, which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.",
      "Validity, which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.",
      "Completeness, which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e.",
      "is a theorem of the system.",
      "Soundness, meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true.",
      "This is the converse of completeness.",
      "(Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound when it is both valid and its premises are true).",
      "Expressivity, meaning what concepts can be expressed in the system.Some logical systems do not have all four properties.",
      "As an example, Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific axioms to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.",
      "=== Logic and rationality ===\n\nAs the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to rationality.",
      "Here we have defined logic to be \"the systematic study of the form of arguments\"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.",
      "Deductive reasoning concerns the logical consequence of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic.",
      "On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.",
      "There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.",
      "These include inductive reasoning, which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and abductive reasoning, which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence.",
      "The American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) first introduced the term as \"guessing\".",
      "Peirce said that to abduce a hypothetical explanation \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   from an observed surprising circumstance \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   is to surmise that \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   may be true because then \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   would be a matter of course.",
      "Thus, to abduce \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   from \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   involves determining that \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   is sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary, for \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  .",
      "While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.",
      "For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or \"strength\", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.",
      "Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of semantics, inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations.",
      "The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association rule induction, while others may use mathematical models of probability such as decision trees.",
      "=== Rival conceptions ===\n\nLogic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of argumentation.",
      "Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference.",
      "For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that logic \"does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole.",
      "That is the job of the theory of rationality.",
      "Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations.",
      "\"Logic has been defined as \"the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form\".",
      "This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to logicism in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.",
      "A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.",
      "Robert Brandom has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of material inference (in the terminology of Wilfred Sellars), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.",
      "== History ==\n\nLogic comes from the Greek word logos, originally meaning \"the word\" or \"what is spoken\", but coming to mean \"thought\" or \"reason\".",
      "In the Western World, logic was first developed by Aristotle, who called the subject 'analytics'.",
      "Aristotelian logic became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th century.",
      "Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic, and inductive logic, as well as influential vocabulary such as terms, predicables, syllogisms and propositions.",
      "There was also the rival Stoic logic.",
      "In Europe during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with Christian faith.",
      "During the High Middle Ages, logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of scholasticism.",
      "In 1323, William of Ockham's influential Summa Logicae was released.",
      "By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in Holberg's satirical play Erasmus Montanus.",
      "The Chinese logical philosopher Gongsun Long (c. 325–250 BCE) proposed the paradox \"One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.\"",
      "In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the Qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy of Han Feizi.",
      "In India, the Anviksiki school of logic was founded by Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE).",
      "Innovations in the scholastic school, called Nyaya, continued from ancient times into the early 18th century with the Navya-Nyaya school.",
      "By the 16th century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlob Frege's \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number\", as well as the theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory.",
      "Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as Charles Babbage, Augustus De Morgan, and George Boole.",
      "In the 20th century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.",
      "The syllogistic logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th century, when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called mathematical logic).",
      "In 1854, George Boole published An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as Boolean logic.",
      "In 1879, Gottlob Frege published Begriffsschrift, which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation, reconciling the Aristotelian and Stoic logics in a broader system, and solving such problems for which Aristotelian logic was impotent, such as the problem of multiple generality.. From 1910 to 1913, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published Principia Mathematica on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic.",
      "In 1931, Gödel raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.",
      "The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see analytic philosophy) and philosophy of mathematics.",
      "Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer logic circuits and is fundamental to computer science.",
      "Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.",
      "== Types ==\n\n\n=== Syllogistic logic ===\n\nThe Organon was Aristotle's body of work on logic, with the Prior Analytics constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.",
      "The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name term logic, are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of syllogisms that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.",
      "Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system.",
      "However, it was not alone: the Stoics proposed a system of propositional logic that was studied by medieval logicians.",
      "Also, the problem of multiple generality was recognized in medieval times.",
      "Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.",
      "Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the predicate calculus.",
      "Others use Aristotle in argumentation theory to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in artificial intelligence and legal arguments.",
      "I was upset.",
      "I had always believed logic was a universal weapon, and now I realized how its validity depended on the way it was employed.",
      "=== Propositional logic ===\n\nA propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives, and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as \"theorems\".",
      "An example of a theorem of propositional logic is \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        →\n        B\n        →\n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow A}\n  , which says that if A holds, then B implies A.",
      "=== Predicate logic ===\n\nPredicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as first-order logic, second-order logic, many-sorted logic, and infinitary logic.",
      "It provides an account of quantifiers general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.",
      "For example, Bertrand Russell's famous barber paradox, \"there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves\" can be formalised by the sentence \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        ∃\n        x\n        )\n        (\n        \n          man\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ∧\n        (\n        ∀\n        y\n        )\n        (\n        \n          man\n        \n        (\n        y\n        )\n        →\n        (\n        \n          shaves\n        \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        ↔\n        ¬\n        \n          shaves\n        \n        (\n        y\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        )\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\exists x)({\\text{man}}(x)\\wedge (\\forall y)({\\text{man}}(y)\\rightarrow ({\\text{shaves}}(x,y)\\leftrightarrow \\neg {\\text{shaves}}(y,y))))}\n  , using the non-logical predicate \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          man\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{man}}(x)}\n   to indicate that x is a man, and the non-logical relation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          shaves\n        \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{shaves}}(x,y)}\n   to indicate that x shaves y; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential quantifiers, conjunction, implication, negation and biconditional.",
      "Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the problem of multiple generality that had perplexed medieval logicians.",
      "The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to Gottlob Frege, who is also credited as one of the founders of analytical philosophy, but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in Principles of Mathematical Logic by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928.",
      "The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of set theory, and allowed the development of Alfred Tarski's approach to model theory.",
      "It provides the foundation of modern mathematical logic.",
      "Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order.",
      "Second-order logic is most prominently defended (against the criticism of Willard Van Orman Quine and others) by George Boolos and Stewart Shapiro.",
      "=== Modal logic ===\n\nIn languages, modality deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles.",
      "For example, \"We go to the games\" can be modified to give \"We should go to the games\", and \"We can go to the games\" and perhaps \"We will go to the games\".",
      "More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied.",
      "Confusing modality is known as the modal fallacy.",
      "Aristotle's logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic.",
      "Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in De Interpretatione § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with potentiality and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of \"temporally modalized\" syllogistic.While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities.",
      "His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include deontic logic and epistemic logic.",
      "The seminal work of Arthur Prior applied the same formal language to treat temporal logic and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects.",
      "Saul Kripke discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of frame semantics, which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new graph-theoretic way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in computational linguistics and computer science, such as dynamic logic.",
      "=== Informal reasoning and dialectic ===\n\nThe motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person.",
      "Half of the works of Aristotle's Organon treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of rhetoric.",
      "This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically dialectical logic forms the heart of a course in critical thinking, a compulsory course at many universities.",
      "Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic.",
      "Dialectical logic is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in Hegelian and Marxist thought.",
      "There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as Stephen Toulmin (The Uses of Argument), Nicholas Rescher (Dialectics), and van Eemeren and Grootendorst (Pragma-dialectics).",
      "Theories of defeasible reasoning can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.",
      "Such games can provide a formal game semantics for many logics.",
      "Argumentation theory is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations.",
      "Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies.",
      "Argumentation theory is now applied in artificial intelligence and law.",
      "=== Mathematical logic ===\n\nMathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.The earliest use of mathematics and geometry in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as Euclid, Plato, and Aristotle.",
      "Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the logicism pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell.",
      "Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical tautologies, and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.",
      "The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his Grundgesetze by Russell's paradox, to the defeat of Hilbert's program by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.",
      "Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of proof theory.",
      "Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, Gödel's completeness theorem, a result in model theory and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's proof calculus is enough to describe the whole of mathematics, though not equivalent to it.",
      "If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.",
      "Set theory originated in the study of the infinite by Georg Cantor, and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from Cantor's theorem, through the status of the Axiom of Choice and the question of the independence of the continuum hypothesis, to the modern debate on large cardinal axioms.",
      "Recursion theory captures the idea of computation in logical and arithmetic terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem by Alan Turing, and his presentation of the Church–Turing thesis.",
      "Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of complexity classes—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of degrees of unsolvability.",
      "=== Philosophical logic ===\n\nPhilosophical logic deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist (\"natural\") language, that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches.",
      "Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found.",
      "Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called \"logic\" before the invention of mathematical logic.",
      "Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic.",
      "As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g.",
      "free logics, tense logics) as well as various extensions of classical logic (e.g.",
      "modal logics) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g.",
      "Kripke's supervaluationism in the semantics of logic).",
      "Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related.",
      "Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking.",
      "Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study.",
      "Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others.",
      "Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.",
      "=== Computational logic ===\n\nLogic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: Alan Turing's work on the Entscheidungsproblem followed from Kurt Gödel's work on the incompleteness theorems.",
      "The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with mathematical notation, it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence.",
      "This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning.",
      "In logic programming, a program consists of a set of axioms and rules.",
      "Logic programming systems such as Prolog compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.",
      "Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer science, and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic.",
      "Argumentation theory is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence.",
      "The ACM Computing Classification System in particular regards:\n\nSection F.3 on Logics and meanings of programs and F.4 on Mathematical logic and formal languages as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers formal semantics of programming languages, as well as work of formal methods such as Hoare logic;\nBoolean logic as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on Arithmetic and logic structures, relating to operatives AND, NOT, and OR;\nMany fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example modal logic and default logic in Knowledge representation formalisms and methods, Horn clauses in logic programming, and description logic.Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians.",
      "For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted.",
      "Using automated theorem proving, the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.",
      "=== Non-classical logic ===\n\nThe logics discussed above are all \"bivalent\" or \"two-valued\"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions.",
      "Non-classical logics are those systems that reject various rules of Classical logic.",
      "Hegel developed his own dialectic logic that extended Kant's transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that \"neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains.",
      "Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself\".In 1910, Nicolai A. Vasiliev extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.",
      "In the early 20th century Jan Łukasiewicz investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, \"possible\", so inventing ternary logic, the first multi-valued logic in the Western tradition.Logics such as fuzzy logic have since been devised with an infinite number of \"degrees of truth\", represented by a real number between 0 and 1.Intuitionistic logic was proposed by L.E.J.",
      "Brouwer as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the law of the excluded middle as part of his intuitionism.",
      "Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student Arend Heyting studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did Gerhard Gentzen.",
      "Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a constructive logic and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of programming languages through the formulae-as-types correspondence.",
      "Modal logic is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic.",
      "However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its relational semantics is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.",
      "== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== \"Is Logic Empirical?\"",
      "===\n\nWhat is the epistemological status of the laws of logic?",
      "What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic?",
      "In an influential paper entitled \"Is Logic Empirical?\"",
      "Hilary Putnam, building on a suggestion of W. V. Quine, argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of mechanics or of general relativity, and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be realists about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the principle of distributivity, substituting for classical logic the quantum logic proposed by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann.Another paper of the same name by Michael Dummett argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.",
      "Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is.",
      "In this way, the question, \"Is Logic Empirical?\"",
      "can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in metaphysics on realism versus anti-realism.",
      "=== Implication: Strict or material ===\n\nThe notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of \"if ... then ...\", due to a number of problems called the paradoxes of material implication.",
      "The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5, which are puzzling because natural language does not support the principle of explosion.",
      "Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for C.I.",
      "Lewis's formulation of strict implication, which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as relevance logic.",
      "The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus \"if that man gets elected, granny will die\" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects.",
      "Such sentences violate the Gricean maxim of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of monotonicity of entailment, such as relevance logic.",
      "=== Tolerating the impossible ===\n\nHegel was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the law of non-contradiction.",
      "It was based on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself.",
      "A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth.",
      "In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.",
      "Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate inconsistency.",
      "Relevance logic and paraconsistent logic are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of classical logic and some of its rivals, such as intuitionistic logic, is that they respect the principle of explosion, which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction.",
      "Graham Priest, the main proponent of dialetheism, has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.",
      "=== Rejection of logical truth ===\nThe philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no logical truths.",
      "This is in contrast with the usual views in philosophical skepticism, where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of Sextus Empiricus.",
      "Friedrich Nietzsche provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a \"... mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short ... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.\"",
      "His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that \"logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense.",
      "Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished\".",
      "Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: \"Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world\".This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons.",
      "Some philosophers, such as Jürgen Habermas, claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.",
      "Georg Lukács, in his book The Destruction of Reason, asserts that, \"Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible.\"",
      "Bertrand Russell described Nietzsche's irrational claims with \"He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers\" in his book A History of Western Philosophy.",

      "Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.",
      "It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.",
      "Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.",
      "Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task.",
      "Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers.",
      "The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.",
      "Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.",
      "In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.",
      "== Overview ==\nThe name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.",
      "Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.",
      "This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\"",
      "is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".",
      "In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.",
      "=== Machine learning tasks ===\n\nMachine learning tasks are classified into several broad categories.",
      "In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.",
      "For example, if the task were determining whether an image contained a certain object, the training data for a supervised learning algorithm would include images with and without that object (the input), and each image would have a label (the output) designating whether it contained the object.",
      "In special cases, the input may be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback.",
      "Semi-supervised learning algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.",
      "Classification algorithms and regression algorithms are types of supervised learning.",
      "Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values.",
      "For a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.",
      "For an algorithm that identifies spam emails, the output would be the prediction of either \"spam\" or \"not spam\", represented by the Boolean values true and false.",
      "Regression algorithms are named for their continuous outputs, meaning they may have any value within a range.",
      "Examples of a continuous value are the temperature, length, or price of an object.",
      "In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels.",
      "Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.",
      "Unsupervised learning can discover patterns in the data, and can group the inputs into categories, as in feature learning.",
      "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of \"features\", or inputs, in a set of data.",
      "Active learning algorithms access the desired outputs (training labels) for a limited set of inputs based on a budget, and optimize the choice of inputs for which it will acquire training labels.",
      "When used interactively, these can be presented to a human user for labeling.",
      "Reinforcement learning algorithms are given feedback in the form of positive or negative reinforcement in a dynamic environment, and are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.",
      "Other specialized algorithms in machine learning include topic modeling, where the computer program is given a set of natural language documents and finds other documents that cover similar topics.",
      "Machine learning algorithms can be used to find the unobservable probability density function in density estimation problems.",
      "Meta learning algorithms learn their own inductive bias based on previous experience.",
      "In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans.",
      "These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation.",
      "== History and relationships to other fields ==\n\nArthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term \"Machine Learning\" in 1959 while at IBM.",
      "As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.",
      "Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data.",
      "They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.",
      "Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.",
      "Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.",
      "By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.",
      "Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.",
      "Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.",
      "This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.",
      "Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.",
      "The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.",
      "It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.",
      "It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet.",
      "=== Relation to data mining ===\nMachine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases).",
      "Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.",
      "Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.",
      "Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.",
      "=== Relation to optimization ===\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.",
      "Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).",
      "The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.",
      "=== Relation to statistics ===\nMachine learning and statistics are closely related fields.",
      "According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.",
      "He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.",
      "Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.",
      "== Theory ==\n\nA core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.",
      "Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.",
      "The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.",
      "The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.",
      "Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.",
      "Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.",
      "The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.",
      "For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.",
      "If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data.",
      "If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.",
      "But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.",
      "In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.",
      "There are two kinds of time complexity results.",
      "Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.",
      "Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.",
      "== Approaches ==\n\n\n=== Types of learning algorithms ===\nThe types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.",
      "==== Supervised and semi-supervised learning ====\n\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.",
      "The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples.",
      "Each training example has one or more inputs and a desired output, also known as a supervisory signal.",
      "In the case of semi-supervised learning algorithms, some of the training examples are missing the desired output.",
      "In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, and the training data by a matrix.",
      "Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.",
      "An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.",
      "An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.Supervised learning algorithms include classification and regression.",
      "Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.",
      "Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.",
      "It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.",
      "==== Unsupervised learning ====\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.",
      "The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.",
      "Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.",
      "A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.",
      "Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.",
      "Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.",
      "Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.",
      "==== Reinforcement learning ====\n\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.",
      "Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.",
      "In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).",
      "Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.",
      "Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.",
      "Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.",
      "=== Processes and techniques ===\nVarious processes, techniques and methods can be applied to one or more types of machine learning algorithms to enhance their performance.",
      "==== Feature learning ====\n\nSeveral learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.",
      "Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis.",
      "Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.",
      "This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution.",
      "This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.",
      "Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.",
      "In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.",
      "Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.",
      "In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.",
      "Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization and various forms of clustering.Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.",
      "Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.",
      "Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.",
      "Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features.",
      "It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.",
      "However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.",
      "An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.",
      "==== Sparse dictionary learning ====\n\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.",
      "The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.",
      "A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.",
      "Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts.",
      "In classification, the problem is to determine to which classes a previously unseen training example belongs.",
      "For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.",
      "Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising.",
      "The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.",
      "==== Anomaly detection ====\n\nIn data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.",
      "Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.",
      "Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts in activity.",
      "This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data, unless it has been aggregated appropriately.",
      "Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.",
      "Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.",
      "Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection).",
      "Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set, and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.",
      "==== Decision trees ====\n\nDecision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).",
      "It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.",
      "Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.",
      "Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.",
      "In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.",
      "In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.",
      "==== Association rules ====\n\nAssociation rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.",
      "It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".",
      "This rule-based approach generates new rules as it analyzes more data.",
      "The ultimate goal, assuming the set of data is large enough, is to help a machine mimic the human brain’s feature extraction and abstract association capabilities for data that has not been categorized.Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge.",
      "The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.",
      "This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.",
      "Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.",
      "Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.",
      "For example, the rule \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          o\n          n\n          i\n          o\n          n\n          s\n          ,\n          p\n          o\n          t\n          a\n          t\n          o\n          e\n          s\n        \n        }\n        ⇒\n        {\n        \n          b\n          u\n          r\n          g\n          e\n          r\n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n   found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.",
      "Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.",
      "In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics.",
      "In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.",
      "Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.",
      "They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.",
      "Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples.",
      "Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.",
      "Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.",
      "Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.",
      "Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.",
      "The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.",
      "=== Models ===\n\n\n==== Artificial neural networks ====\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",
      "The neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.",
      "Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.",
      "An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.",
      "Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another.",
      "An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.",
      "In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.",
      "The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\".",
      "Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.",
      "The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.",
      "Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.",
      "Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.",
      "Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.",
      "Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",
      "The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.",
      "However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.",
      "Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.",
      "Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.",
      "This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.",
      "Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.",
      "==== Support vector machines ====\n\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.",
      "Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.",
      "An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting.",
      "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.",
      "==== Bayesian networks ====\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).",
      "For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",
      "Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.",
      "Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.",
      "Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.",
      "Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.",
      "==== Genetic algorithms ====\n\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.",
      "In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.",
      "== Applications ==\nThere are many applications for machine learning, including:\n\nIn 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.",
      "A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.",
      "Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.",
      "In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.",
      "In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.",
      "In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.",
      "== Limitations ==\nAlthough machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.",
      "Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.",
      "Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of investment.",
      "=== Bias ===\n\nMachine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.",
      "A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.",
      "When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.",
      "Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.",
      "Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.",
      "In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorilla from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.",
      "Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.",
      "In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.",
      "Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.",
      "Concern for reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that \"There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people.",
      "It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”\n\n\n== Model assessments ==\nClassification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.",
      "In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.",
      "In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.",
      "Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR).",
      "However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.",
      "The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.",
      "TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).",
      "== Ethics ==\nMachine learning poses a host of ethical questions.",
      "Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.",
      "For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.",
      "Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.",
      "Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.",
      "There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest, but as income generating machines.",
      "This is especially true in the United States where there is a perpetual ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.",
      "For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes in.",
      "There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.",

      "In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.",
      "In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.",
      "On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us.",
      "The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.",
      "The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.",
      "In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video.",
      "In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \"just about tech wanting to hire more people\", the Internet entrepreneur replied: \"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.",
      "\"In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration.",
      "The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march.",
      "The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.",
      "When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \"blew it.\"",
      "He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015 which said that he wants \"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.",
      "The statement also said that Muslims are \"always welcome\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that \"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.",
      "\"On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place.",
      "Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls.",
      "The memo was then leaked by several employees.",
      "As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well.\"",
      "According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.\"",
      "The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's.\"",
      "Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.",
      "New York's Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, \"Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.",

      "Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, \"knowledge, study, learning\") includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof.",
      "When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature.",
      "Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.",
      "Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist.",
      "The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.",
      "Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements.",
      "Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.",
      "Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences.",
      "Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory.",
      "Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.",
      "== History ==\n\nThe history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions.",
      "The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.",
      "As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time – days, seasons, years.Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.",
      "The most ancient mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000–1800 BC.",
      "Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.",
      "It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first appear in the archaeological record.",
      "The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a sexagesimal numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.Beginning in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with Greek mathematics.",
      "Around 300 BC, Euclid introduced the axiomatic method still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.",
      "His textbook Elements is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.",
      "The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) of Syracuse.",
      "He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.",
      "Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC), trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea (2nd century BC), and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics.",
      "Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.",
      "During the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics.",
      "The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra.",
      "Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system.",
      "Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarismi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī.",
      "During the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe.",
      "The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics.",
      "Leonhard Euler was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries.",
      "Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics.",
      "In the early 20th century, Kurt Gödel transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.",
      "Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both.",
      "Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today.",
      "According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year.",
      "The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"",
      "=== Etymology ===\nThe word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek μάθημα (máthēma), meaning \"that which is learnt\", \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\".",
      "The word for \"mathematics\" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even in Classical times.",
      "Its adjective is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\".",
      "In particular, μαθηματικὴ τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant \"the mathematical art\".",
      "Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant \"teachers\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense.",
      "In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800.",
      "This has resulted in several mistranslations.",
      "For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and the less commonly used singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τὰ μαθηματικά (ta mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, which were inherited from Greek.",
      "In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb.",
      "It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.",
      "== Definitions of mathematics ==\n\nMathematics has no generally accepted definition.",
      "Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.",
      "Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.",
      "It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.",
      "Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.\"",
      "Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".",
      "Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\".",
      "David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense.",
      "Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules.",
      "Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.\"",
      "Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.",
      "\"Starting in the 19th century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.",
      "Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.",
      "Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails, even among professionals.",
      "There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.",
      "A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.",
      "Some just say, \"Mathematics is what mathematicians do.",
      "\"Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.",
      "All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce's \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\" (1870).",
      "In the Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of symbolic logic.",
      "A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's \"All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic\" (1903).Intuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena.",
      "An example of an intuitionist definition is \"Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other.\"",
      "A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions.",
      "In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.",
      "Formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them.",
      "Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as \"the science of formal systems\".",
      "A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas.",
      "In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of \"a self-evident truth\".",
      "In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.",
      "=== Mathematics as science ===\n\nThe German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".",
      "More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery\".",
      "In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a \"field of knowledge\", and this was the original meaning of \"science\" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge.",
      "The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles.",
      "The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics.",
      "Albert Einstein stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.",
      "\"Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper.",
      "However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that \"most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently.\"",
      "Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality.",
      "Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions.",
      "Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences.",
      "Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.",
      "The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied.",
      "Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.",
      "One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science).",
      "It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide.",
      "In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels.",
      "This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.",
      "== Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics ==\n\nMathematics arises from many different kinds of problems.",
      "At first these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself.",
      "For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area.",
      "But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts.",
      "A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics.",
      "However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g.",
      "number theory in cryptography.",
      "This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called \"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics\".",
      "As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46 pages.",
      "Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.",
      "For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics.",
      "Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty.",
      "Simplicity and generality are valued.",
      "There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform.",
      "G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics.",
      "He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.",
      "Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object.",
      "A theorem expressed as a characterization of the object by these features is the prize.",
      "Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in Proofs from THE BOOK.",
      "The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.",
      "And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in philosophy of mathematics, such as the nature of mathematical proof.",
      "== Notation, language, and rigor ==\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.",
      "Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.",
      "Euler (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today.",
      "Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting.",
      "According to Barbara Oakley, this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language.",
      "Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.",
      "Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.Mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as or and only, have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings.",
      "Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics.",
      "Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for \"if and only if\" belong to mathematical jargon.",
      "There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech.",
      "Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".",
      "Mathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor.",
      "Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning.",
      "This is to avoid mistaken \"theorems\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.",
      "The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous.",
      "Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century.",
      "Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics.",
      "Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs.",
      "Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.Axioms in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.",
      "At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system.",
      "It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible.",
      "Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.",
      "== Fields of mathematics ==\n\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e.",
      "arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis).",
      "In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty.",
      "While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.",
      "=== Foundations and philosophy ===\nIn order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed.",
      "Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects.",
      "Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still in development.",
      "The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.",
      "Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day.",
      "The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy.",
      "Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework.",
      "As such, it is home to Gödel's incompleteness theorems which (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic, if sound (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system).",
      "Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms.",
      "Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory.",
      "Modern logic is divided into recursion theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science, as well as to category theory.",
      "In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a consequence of the MRDP theorem.",
      "Theoretical computer science includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory.",
      "Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine.",
      "Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware.",
      "A famous problem is the \"P = NP?\"",
      "problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems.",
      "Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.",
      "=== Pure mathematics ===\n\n\n==== Quantity ====\n\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic.",
      "The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem.",
      "The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.",
      "As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers (\"fractions\").",
      "These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities.",
      "Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers.",
      "These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions.",
      "Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of \"infinity\".",
      "According to the fundamental theorem of algebra all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree.",
      "Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the cardinal numbers.",
      "These include the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.",
      "==== Structure ====\n\nMany mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set.",
      "Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations.",
      "Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms.",
      "Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.",
      "By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory.",
      "Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space.",
      "This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics.",
      "Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.",
      "==== Space ====\n\nThe study of space originates with geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem.",
      "Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions.",
      "The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play a central role in general relativity) and topology.",
      "Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry.",
      "Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science.",
      "Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus.",
      "Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and space.",
      "Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change.",
      "Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential topology.",
      "In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory.",
      "Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture.",
      "Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.",
      "==== Change ====\n\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it.",
      "Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity.",
      "The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers.",
      "Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions.",
      "One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics.",
      "Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations.",
      "Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.",
      "=== Applied mathematics ===\n\nApplied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry.",
      "Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge.",
      "The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.",
      "In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake.",
      "Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.",
      "==== Statistics and other decision sciences ====\n\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability theory.",
      "Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with random sampling and with randomized experiments; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available).",
      "When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data.Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best.",
      "In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.",
      "Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.",
      "==== Computational mathematics ====\nComputational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity.",
      "Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors.",
      "Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory.",
      "Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.",
      "== Mathematical awards ==\nArguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals.",
      "The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.",
      "The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was instituted in 2003.",
      "The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement.",
      "These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.",
      "A famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert.",
      "This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved.",
      "A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000.",
      "Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems.",
      "A solution to any of these problems carries a $1 million reward.",

      "The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer, which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device.",
      "After a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration.",
      "Since they didn't yet have one, Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter.",
      "Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, it worked flawlessly when they (in March 1975) demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
      "MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.",
      "Gates and Allen officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO.",
      "The original name of \"Micro-Soft\" (short for microcomputer software) was suggested by Allen.",

      "Microsoft moved to a new home in Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.Microsoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.",
      "However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance.",
      "After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).",
      "For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, which it branded as MS-DOS, though IBM rebranded it to PC DOS.",
      "Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS.",
      "Since IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems.",
      "Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.",

      "Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.",
      "In 1990, due to the partnership with IBM, the Federal Trade Commission set its eye on Microsoft for possible collusion, marking the beginning of over a decade of legal clashes with the U.S. government.",
      "Meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code.",
      "It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface (API), making porting from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows easier.",
      "Once Microsoft informed IBM of NT, the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.In 1990, Microsoft introduced its office suite, Microsoft Office.",
      "The suite bundled separate productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.",

      "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.",
      "Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.",
      "== History ==\nThe history of natural language processing generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.",
      "In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.",
      "The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English.",
      "The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.",
      "However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.",
      "Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.",
      "Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.",
      "Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction.",
      "When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\".",
      "During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.",
      "Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).",
      "During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky.",
      "Up to the 1980s,most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.",
      "Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.",
      "This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g.",
      "transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.",
      "Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.",
      "However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data.",
      "The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.",
      "Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.",
      "Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.",
      "These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.",
      "However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems.",
      "As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.",
      "Recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms.",
      "Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.",
      "Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.",
      "However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.",
      "In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,\nparsing, and many others.",
      "Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing).",
      "In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing.",
      "For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
      "== Rule-based vs. statistical NLP ==\nIn the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules,, e.g.",
      "by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.",
      "However, this is rarely robust to natural language variation.",
      "Since the so-called \"statistical revolution\"\nin the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning.",
      "The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora of typical real-world examples (a corpus (plural, \"corpora\") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).",
      "Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks.",
      "These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data.",
      "Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common.",
      "Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature.",
      "Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.",
      "Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:\n\nThe learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.",
      "Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g.",
      "containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g.",
      "with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted).",
      "Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or, more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.",
      "Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data.",
      "However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.",
      "In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.",
      "However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.",
      "== Major evaluations and tasks ==\nThe following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.",
      "Note that some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.",
      "Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience.",
      "A coarse division is given below.",
      "=== Syntax ===\nGrammar induction\nGenerate a formal grammar that describes a language's syntax.",
      "Lemmatization\nThe task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma.",
      "Morphological segmentation\nSeparate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes.",
      "The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e.",
      "the structure of words) of the language being considered.",
      "English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g.",
      "\"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words.",
      "In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.",
      "Part-of-speech tagging\nGiven a sentence, determine the part of speech for each word.",
      "Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts of speech.",
      "For example, \"book\" can be a noun (\"the book on the table\") or verb (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.",
      "Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.",
      "Languages with little inflectional morphology, such as English, are particularly prone to such ambiguity.",
      "Chinese is prone to such ambiguity because it is a tonal language during verbalization.",
      "Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.",
      "Parsing\n(see also: Stochastic grammar) Determine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.",
      "The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.",
      "In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human).",
      "There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing.",
      "Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG).",
      "Sentence breaking (also known as sentence boundary disambiguation)\nGiven a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.",
      "Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g.",
      "marking abbreviations).",
      "Stemming\nThe process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their root form.",
      "(e.g.",
      "\"close\" will be the root for \"closed\", \"closing\", \"close\", \"closer\" etc).",
      "Word segmentation\nSeparate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.",
      "For a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.",
      "However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language.",
      "Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining.",
      "Terminology extraction\nThe goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.",
      "=== Semantics ===\nLexical semantics\nWhat is the computational meaning of individual words in context?",
      "Machine translation\nAutomatically translate text from one human language to another.",
      "This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\", i.e.",
      "requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.)",
      "in order to solve properly.",
      "Named entity recognition (NER)\nGiven a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g.",
      "person, location, organization).",
      "Note that, although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.",
      "For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.",
      "Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g.",
      "Chinese or Arabic) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names.",
      "For example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they are names, and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives.",
      "Natural language generation\nConvert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.",
      "Natural language understanding\nConvert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate.",
      "Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts.",
      "Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions.",
      "An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed-world assumption (CWA) vs. open-world assumption, or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.",
      "Optical character recognition (OCR)\nGiven an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.",
      "Question answering\nGiven a human-language question, determine its answer.",
      "Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?",
      "\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \"What is the meaning of life?\").",
      "Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.",
      "Recognizing Textual entailment\nGiven two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.",
      "Relationship extraction\nGiven a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g.",
      "who is married to whom).",
      "Sentiment analysis (see also multimodal sentiment analysis)\nExtract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine \"polarity\" about specific objects.",
      "It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.",
      "Topic segmentation and recognition\nGiven a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.",
      "Word sense disambiguation\nMany words have more than one meaning; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.",
      "For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g.",
      "from a dictionary or from an online resource such as WordNet.",
      "=== Discourse ===\nAutomatic summarization\nProduce a readable summary of a chunk of text.",
      "Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.",
      "Coreference resolution\nGiven a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\").",
      "Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer.",
      "The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging relationships\" involving referring expressions.",
      "For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John's house through the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).",
      "Discourse analysis\nThis rubric includes a number of related tasks.",
      "One task is identifying the discourse structure of connected text, i.e.",
      "the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g.",
      "elaboration, explanation, contrast).",
      "Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text (e.g.",
      "yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).",
      "=== Speech ===\nSpeech recognition\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.",
      "This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\" (see above).",
      "In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).",
      "Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.",
      "Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent.",
      "Speech segmentation\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.",
      "A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it.",
      "Text-to-speech\nGiven a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation.",
      "Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.",
      "=== Dialogue ===\nThe first published work by an artificial intelligence was published in 2018, 1 the Road, marketed as a novel, contains sixty million words.",
      "== History of NLP ==\nThe first major study was conducted in 2013, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) with a workshop called: \"Rediscovering 50 Years of Discoveries in Natural Language Processing .",
      "The same year, started the NLP4NLP project with the aim of discovering which terms are introduced along the years, with details concerning the authors and the conferences involved \n.",
      "Then the project was extended to other directions while covering 34 conferences in speech and NLP.",

    "content": [
      "Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.",
      "The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes.",
      "When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.",
      "The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information.",
      "Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions.",
      "All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy.",
      "An example of this would be law concerning taxation, which normally requires the sharing of information about personal income or earnings.",
      "In some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.",
      "This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of Citizens United.Privacy may be voluntarily sacrificed, normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships.",
      "For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.",
      "Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.",
      "In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for advertising purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize.",
      "A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.",
      "Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to identity theft.",
      "The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with Western culture, British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times.",
      "According to some researchers, this concept sets Anglo-American culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.",
      "Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.",
      "The distinction or overlap between secrecy and privacy is ontologically subtle, which is why the word \"privacy\" is an example of an untranslatable lexeme, and many languages do not have a specific word for \"privacy\".",
      "Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of уединение—solitude, секретность—secrecy, and частная жизнь—private life) or borrow from English \"privacy\" (as Indonesian privasi or Italian la privacy).",
      "The distinction hinges on the discreteness of interests of parties (persons or groups), which can have emic variation depending on cultural mores of individualism, collectivism, and the negotiation between individual and group rights.",
      "The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, \"when I withhold information, it is privacy; when you withhold information, it is secrecy.\"",
      "== Concepts ==\nA broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.",
      "One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:\nthe right to be let alone\nthe option to limit the access others have to one's personal information\nsecrecy, or the option to conceal any information from others\ncontrol over others' use of information about oneself\nstates of privacy\npersonhood and autonomy\nself-identity and personal growth\nprotection of intimate relationships\n\n\n=== Right to be let alone ===\nIn 1890 the United States jurists Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote The Right to Privacy, an article in which they argued for the \"right to be let alone\", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.",
      "There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being \"let alone\", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one's own home.",
      "Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.",
      "=== Limited access ===\nLimited access refers to a person's ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one's personal information.",
      "Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that \"nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion.\"",
      "Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison 9 years earlier, Sissela Bok said that privacy is \"the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention.\"",
      "=== Control over information ===\nControl over one's personal information is the concept that \"privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.\"",
      "Charles Fried said that \"Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves.",
      "Nevertheless, in the era of big data, control over information is under pressure.",
      "=== States of privacy ===\nAlan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve.",
      "Solitude is a physical separation from others.",
      "Intimacy is a \"close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals\" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.",
      "Anonymity is the \"desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'\"",
      "Lastly, reserve is the \"creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion\"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative.",
      "Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.",
      "(In this sense, \"accessing\" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)",
      "Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.",
      "Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.",
      "=== Secrecy ===\nPrivacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy.",
      "Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to \"conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage\".In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.",
      "When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.",
      "=== Personhood and autonomy ===\nPrivacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood.",
      "Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.",
      "Through the \"social ritual\" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.",
      "This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.",
      "Privacy is required to exercise choice.",
      "Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a \"determinate character\" and \"limited probabilities.\"",
      "Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood.",
      "According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a \"purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent\" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.",
      "Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.",
      "In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of \"total institutions\" such as prisons and mental institutions, suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.",
      "=== Self-identity and personal growth ===\nPrivacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity.",
      "Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process.",
      "According to Irwin Altman, such barriers \"define and limit the boundaries of the self\" and thus \"serve to help define [the self].\"",
      "This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.",
      "Control over the \"permeability\" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity.",
      "Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.",
      "Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.",
      "=== Intimacy ===\nIn a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans.",
      "Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.James Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because \"there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people.\"",
      "=== Concepts in popular media ===\nPrivacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an invasion of privacy.",
      "==== Personal privacy ====\nMost people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others.",
      "This is an aspect of personal modesty.",
      "A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of clothes.",
      "Other ways include erection of walls, fences, screens, use of cathedral glass, partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways.",
      "People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others.",
      "At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of physical intimacy, but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing.",
      "Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.",
      "Physical privacy could be defined as preventing \"intrusions into one's physical space or solitude.\"",
      "This would include concerns such as:\n\nPreventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of modesty; apart from being dressed this can be achieved by walls, fences, privacy screens, cathedral glass, partitions between urinals, by being far away from others, on a bed by a bed sheet or a blanket, when changing clothes by a towel, etc.",
      "; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being heard varies\nVideo, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts\nPreventing searching of one's personal possessions\nPreventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle\nMedical privacy, the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraceptionAn example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. Fourth Amendment, which guarantees \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\".",
      "Most countries have laws regarding trespassing and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.",
      "Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness.",
      "There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking.",
      "Civil inattention is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.",
      "==== Informational ====\n\nInformation or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self.",
      "Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise.",
      "In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated.",
      "In other cases the issue is who is given access to information.",
      "Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.",
      "Various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns.",
      "Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability.",
      "First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available.",
      "Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation.",
      "An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability.",
      "Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else.",
      "This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it.",
      "For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid discrimination, personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.",
      "Financial privacy, in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of fraud including identity theft.",
      "Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc.",
      "In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals.",
      "Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that does not share this information with other countries can help countries in fighting tax avoidance.",
      "Internet privacy is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used.",
      "For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share personally identifiable information about them.",
      "Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their email was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent.",
      "Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like I2P and Tor.",
      "Medical privacy Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments.",
      "Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity.",
      "A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to acquire and use contraceptives without family, community or legal sanctions.",
      "Political privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times.",
      "The secret ballot helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote.",
      "Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern democracy, and considered a basic right of citizenship, despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).",
      "Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations.",
      "Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.",
      "==== Organizational ====\nGovernment agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential.",
      "Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets.",
      "For example, a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege or declare certain information to be classified, or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets.",
      "==== Spiritual and intellectual ====\nThe earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under British common law, which protected \"only the physical interference of life and property.\"",
      "Its development from then on became \"one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law.\"",
      "Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a \"recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.\"",
      "Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic \"right to be let alone\", and the former definition of \"property\" would then comprise \"every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible.\"",
      "By the late 19th century, interest in a \"right to privacy\" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.",
      "== History ==\n\nPrivacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the polis, associated with political life, and the private sphere of the oikos, associated with domestic life.",
      "More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.",
      "=== Technology ===\n\nAs technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it.",
      "In the case of some technologies, such as the printing press or the Internet, the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached.",
      "It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, \"The Right to Privacy\", 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890), that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information.",
      "For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable.",
      "However, in 2001 in Kyllo v. United States (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy.",
      "As large-scale information systems become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access.",
      "Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned.",
      "The concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear.",
      "Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe.",
      "Privacy law in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights.",
      "But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient.",
      "Proposals such as the APEC Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.",
      "There are various theories about privacy and privacy control.",
      "The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual.",
      "This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others.",
      "In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent.",
      "The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone's concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance.",
      "The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a \"right to privacy.\"",
      "Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others.",
      "Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy.",
      "He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element.",
      "There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection.",
      "Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems.",
      "People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself.",
      "Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure.",
      "He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government.",
      "Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.",
      "Another trend is the design of privacy aware algorithms and sensors by designers.",
      "These include the use of privacy preserving sensors, privacy policies regarding data-sharing in a collaborative and distributive environment and data ownership itself for visual privacy.",
      "For example, face detection algorithms are used by Google Streetview to blur out the faces detected while collecting data for Google maps.",
      "There has also been an emergence of context-aware visual privacy and sensors that only use depth or thermal imaging data to obfuscate the user and redact sensitive information.",
      "=== Internet ===\n\nThe Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: \"where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever\", writes law professor and author Jeffrey Rosen.This currently has an effect on employment.",
      "Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter.",
      "They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information.",
      "This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade.",
      "Facebook for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily.",
      "Over 83.09 million accounts were fake.",
      "Twitter has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users.",
      "The Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.",
      "Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g.",
      "by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).",
      "According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users.",
      "Senator Al Franken has noted the seriousness of iPhones and iPads having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files, although Apple denied doing so.Andrew Grove, co-founder and former CEO of Intel Corporation, offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:\nPrivacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age.",
      "At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you.",
      "And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset.",
      "This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.",
      "== Actions which reduce privacy ==\nAs with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy.",
      "In 1960 legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:\nIntrusion into a person's private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude\nPublic disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed\nPromoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them\nEncroaching someone's personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their ownBuilding from this and other historical precedents, Daniel J. Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.",
      "=== Collecting information ===\nIn the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.",
      "Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.",
      "Examples of information collection agencies include the NSA and the participants in the Five Eyes program.",
      "=== Aggregating information ===\nIt can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.",
      "Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:\ndata aggregation, which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information\nidentification, which can mean breaking the de-identification of items of data by putting it through a de-anonymization process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people\ninsecurity, such as lack of data security, which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a data breach which harms the people whose data it held\nsecondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ informed consent\nexclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage\n\n\n=== Information dissemination ===\nCount not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.",
      "Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.There are various examples of this.",
      "Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person's information private, then breaks that promise.",
      "Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.",
      "Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.",
      "Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.",
      "Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.",
      "Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.",
      "Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.",
      "=== Invasions ===\nInvasion of privacy, a subset of expectation of privacy, is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.",
      "An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.",
      "\"Decisional interference\" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.",
      "== Right to privacy ==\n\nPrivacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies.",
      "In North America, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis wrote that privacy is the \"right to be let alone\" (Warren & Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals.",
      "This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as yellow journalism.Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology.",
      "In his widely cited dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his Harvard Law Review article in 1890.",
      "But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying \"the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader.\"",
      "He writes, \"Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\"",
      "At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators.",
      "By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical.",
      "In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles.",
      "=== Definitions ===\nIn recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a \"right to privacy.\"",
      "Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy \"should not be defined as a separate legal right\" at all.",
      "By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.",
      "Other experts, such as Dean Prosser, have attempted, but failed, to find a \"common ground\" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.",
      "One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of \"privacy in the digital environment\", suggests that the \"right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.\"",
      "It has therefore proposed a working definition for a \"right to privacy\":\n\nThe right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity.",
      "The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.",
      "=== An individual right ===\nAlan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes.",
      "Westin defines privacy as \"the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\".",
      "Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve.",
      "These states must balance participation against norms:\n\nEach individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.",
      "— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968\n\nUnder liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression.",
      "David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.",
      "He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\".",
      "This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.",
      "Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.",
      "Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.",
      "For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product.",
      "Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.",
      "For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.",
      "Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\".",
      "Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.",
      "=== A collective \"value\" and a \"human right\" ===\nThere have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.",
      "Amitai Etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy.",
      "This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.",
      "Etzioni believes that \"[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others\", and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid).",
      "He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.",
      "Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy.",
      "Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or \"Privacy Merchants,\" stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder.",
      "And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.",
      "She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components.",
      "Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.",
      "Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.",
      "Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.",
      "Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.",
      "Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate.",
      "Violations of privacy depend on context.",
      "The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"",
      "Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.",
      "== Protection ==\n\nMost countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.",
      "Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil, which says \"the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable\"; the Constitution of South Africa says that \"everyone has a right to privacy\"; and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says \"the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed.\"",
      "Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia's Privacy Act 1988, Argentina's Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada's 2000 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and Japan's 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.",
      "The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights says \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.\"",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980.",
      "The European Union's 1995 Data Protection Directive guides privacy protection in Europe.",
      "The 2004 Privacy Framework by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.",
      "Vance Packard’s The Naked Society was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.",
      "=== Free market versus consumer protection approaches ===\nApproaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.",
      "In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree.",
      "If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share.",
      "Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices.",
      "Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.",
      "One example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data.",
      "The principles reflected in the guidelines are analysed in an article putting them into perspective with concepts of the GDPR put into law later in the European Union.In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.",
      "In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.",
      "Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.",
      "=== Privacy law ===\n\nPrivacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals.",
      "While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries.",
      "For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 12, states:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.",
      "Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.",
      "==== Australia ====\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 is administered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.",
      "Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years.",
      "The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles.",
      "State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation.",
      "This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.The Privacy Act 1988 was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles.",
      "These took effect in 2001.",
      "Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3 million were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law.",
      "The resulting report \"For Your Information\".",
      "was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC.",
      "Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014.",
      "The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:\n\nopen and transparent management of personal information\nanonymity and pseudonymity\ncollection of solicited personal information\ndealing with unsolicited personal information\nnotification of the collection of personal information\nuse or disclosure of personal information\ndirect marketing\ncross-border disclosure of personal information\nadoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers\nquality of personal information\nsecurity of personal information\naccess to personal information\ncorrection of personal informationAs of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia's Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).",

      "Several methods to protect user privacy in location-based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a.",
      "Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.",
      "Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e.",
      "\"In the City\" or \"Philadelphia\" or \"Work\") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.",
      "In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the National Do Not Call Registry, telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.",
      "The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both Federal Trade Commission and companies like PrivacyStar.",
      "Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.",
      "=== Privacy by design ===\nThe principle of privacy by design states that privacy and data protection are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of technologies, from the early design stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.",
      "=== Privacy engineering ===\nThe practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as Privacy engineering\n\n\n=== Privacy self-synchronization ===\nPrivacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success.",
      "The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors.",
      "When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.",
      "== Privacy paradox ==\nThe privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.",
      "While this term was coined as early as 1998, it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.",
      "In his article titled \"'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox,\" John Schwartz wrote that \"It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life.",
      "While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information.",
      "…The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy.\"",
      "Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.",
      "When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media.",
      "However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy.",
      "Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online.",
      "However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.",
      "Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings.",
      "Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.",
      "A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.",
      "Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online.",
      "On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.",
      "For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.",
      "Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.",
      "Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.",
      "== The right to privacy in popular culture ==\nThe 1993 film The Pelican Brief, based on the novel of the same name, touches on privacy.",
      "In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy.",
      "One of his students, played by Julia Roberts, argues that the majority opinion in Bowers v Hardwick was wrongly decided.",

      "Sam Seabourne ventures the opinion that Internet privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.",
      "=== Selfie culture ===\nSelfies are popular today.",
      "A search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and \"a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me\"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.",
      "In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users.",
      "Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.",

    "content": [
      "A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.",
      "Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.",
      "Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.",
      "There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.",
      "Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.",
      "Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.",
      "The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.",
      "Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.",
      "Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e.",
      "the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).",
      "The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).",
      "Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.",
      "Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.",
      "== Definitions ==\nA programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.",
      "Some authors restrict the term \"programming language\" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.",
      "Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:\n\nFunction and target\nA computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on.",
      "For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display.",
      "More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine.",
      "It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.",
      "In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.",
      "Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.",
      "Abstractions\nProgramming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution.",
      "The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.",
      "This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.",
      "Expressive power\nThe theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing.",
      "All Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms.",
      "ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet often called programming languages.Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages.",
      "Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined.",
      "XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax.",
      "Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset.The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.",
      "However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each.",
      "One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.",
      "Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages.",
      "For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.",
      "John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution.",
      "He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.",
      "== History ==\n\n\n=== Early developments ===\nVery early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.",
      "Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly.",
      "For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations.",
      "The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer.",
      "Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages (1GL).",
      "The next step was development of so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer.",
      "These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.",
      "The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), were written in the 1950s.",
      "An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkül, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945.",
      "However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.",
      "Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form.",
      "However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.",
      "At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s.",
      "As a programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code.",
      "The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language.The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the \"Mark 1 Autocode\".",
      "Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester.",
      "The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961.",
      "Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time.",
      "A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.",
      "In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus.",
      "It was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.",
      "It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC.",
      "It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959.",
      "Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype.",
      "The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.",
      "FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.",
      "=== Refinement ===\nThe increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for low-level programming languages or system programming languages.",
      "These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages.",
      "They can be used to perform tasks which require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.",
      "The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use:\n\nAPL introduced array programming and influenced functional programming.",
      "ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming and the discipline of language specification; the \"Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60\" became a model for how later language specifications were written.",
      "Lisp, implemented in 1958, was the first dynamically typed functional programming language.",
      "In the 1960s, Simula was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming; in the mid-1970s, Smalltalk followed with the first \"purely\" object-oriented language.",
      "C was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the Unix operating system and remains popular.",
      "Prolog, designed in 1972, was the first logic programming language.",
      "In 1978, ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional programming languages.Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.",
      "The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming, and whether programming languages should be designed to support it.",
      "Edsger Dijkstra, in a famous 1968 letter published in the Communications of the ACM, argued that GOTO statements should be eliminated from all \"higher level\" programming languages.",
      "=== Consolidation and growth ===\n\nThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation.",
      "C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming.",
      "The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors.",
      "In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called \"fifth-generation\" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs.",
      "The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp.",
      "Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.",
      "One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules or large-scale organizational units of code.",
      "Modula-2, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to generic programming constructs.The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages.",
      "Perl, originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic websites.",
      "Java came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"Write once, run anywhere\" (UCSD Pascal had been popular for a time in the early 1980s).",
      "These developments were not fundamentally novel, rather they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).",
      "Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research.",
      "Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity (mixins, delegates, aspects), and database integration such as Microsoft's LINQ.",
      "Fourth-generation programming languages (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs.",
      "Fifth-generation programming languages (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer.",
      "== Elements ==\nAll programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection).",
      "These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.",
      "=== Syntax ===\n\nA programming language's surface form is known as its syntax.",
      "Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages.",
      "On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.",
      "The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program.",
      "The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation).",
      "Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.",
      "Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus–Naur form (for grammatical structure).",
      "Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:\n\nThis grammar specifies the following:\n\nan expression is either an atom or a list;\nan atom is either a number or a symbol;\na number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\na symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\na list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it.The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: 12345, () and (a b c232 (1)).",
      "Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct.",
      "Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution.",
      "In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior.",
      "Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.",
      "Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n\n\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.\"",
      "is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.",
      "\"John is a married bachelor.\"",
      "is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation *p >> 4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p->im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointer):\n\nIf the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable \"p\" during compilation.",
      "However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.",
      "The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy.",
      "The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars.",
      "Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase.",
      "Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution.",
      "In contrast to Lisp's macro system and Perl's BEGIN blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.",
      "=== Semantics ===\nThe term semantics refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form (syntax).",
      "==== Static semantics ====\nThe static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms.",
      "For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time.",
      "Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct.",
      "Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g.",
      "not adding an integer to a function name), or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system.",
      "Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics.",
      "Newer programming languages like Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.",
      "==== Dynamic semantics ====\n\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data.",
      "For example, the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements.",
      "The dynamic semantics (also known as execution semantics) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior.",
      "There are many ways of defining execution semantics.",
      "Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice.",
      "A significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner.",
      "Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.",
      "=== Type system ===\n\nA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact.",
      "The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations.",
      "Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs.",
      "In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types.",
      "In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations.",
      "The formal design and study of type systems is known as type theory.",
      "==== Typed versus untyped languages ====\nA language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.",
      "For example, the data represented by \"this text between the quotes\" is a string, and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed.",
      "The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time exception.",
      "Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.",
      "A special case of typed languages are the single-typed languages.",
      "These are often scripting or markup languages, such as REXX or SGML, and have only one data type–—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.",
      "In contrast, an untyped language, such as most assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.",
      "High-level untyped languages include BCPL, Tcl, and some varieties of Forth.",
      "In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the type theory (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.",
      "Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see casting).",
      "==== Static versus dynamic typing ====\nIn static typing, all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time.",
      "For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.Statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed or type-inferred.",
      "In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable declarations).",
      "In the second case, the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context.",
      "Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as C++, C# and Java, are manifestly typed.",
      "Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as Haskell and ML.",
      "However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, C++, Java and C# all infer types in certain limited cases.",
      "Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.",
      "Dynamic typing, also called latent typing, determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions.",
      "As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions.",
      "Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution.",
      "However, type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making debugging more difficult.",
      "Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are all examples of dynamically typed languages.",
      "==== Weak and strong typing ====\nWeak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number.",
      "This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at compile time and even at run time.",
      "Strong typing prevents these program faults.",
      "An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.",
      "Strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe or safe.",
      "An alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as Perl and JavaScript, which permit a large number of implicit type conversions.",
      "In JavaScript, for example, the expression 2 * x implicitly converts x to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if x is null, undefined, an Array, or a string of letters.",
      "Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.",
      "Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs.",
      "Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed.",
      "Thus C has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\".",
      "However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the void* pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast.",
      "This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as (int) or (char).",
      "=== Standard library and run-time system ===\n\nMost programming languages have an associated core library (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language.",
      "Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.",
      "The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language.",
      "In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language.",
      "However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations.",
      "Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library.",
      "For example, in Java, a string literal is defined as an instance of the java.lang.String class; similarly, in Smalltalk, an anonymous function expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's BlockContext class.",
      "Conversely, Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.",
      "== Design and implementation ==\nProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related languages branching one from another.",
      "But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage.",
      "A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety, since it has a precise and finite definition.",
      "By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities.",
      "While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.",
      "Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages.",
      "Many have eventually fallen into disuse.",
      "Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.",
      "The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n\nPrograms range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers.",
      "Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.",
      "Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers.",
      "Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.",
      "Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction.",
      "The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer.",
      "As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions.",
      "Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer.",
      "This lets them write more functionality per time unit.",
      "Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming.",
      "However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate.",
      "Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as \"foolish\".",
      "Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea.",
      "Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English and SQL.",
      "A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming.",
      "The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation.",
      "=== Specification ===\n\nThe specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.",
      "A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:\n\nAn explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language.",
      "While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in natural language (e.g., as in the C language), or a formal semantics (e.g., as in Standard ML and Scheme specifications).",
      "A description of the behavior of a translator for the language (e.g., the C++ and Fortran specifications).",
      "The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.",
      "A reference or model implementation, sometimes written in the language being specified (e.g., Prolog or ANSI REXX).",
      "The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.",
      "=== Implementation ===\n\nAn implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software.",
      "There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: compilation and interpretation.",
      "It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.",
      "The output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter.",
      "In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting.",
      "For instance, some implementations of BASIC compile and then execute the source a line at a time.",
      "Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is just-in-time compilation.",
      "Here the virtual machine, just before execution, translates the blocks of bytecode which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.",
      "== Proprietary languages ==\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property.",
      "Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.",
      "Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language, and Microsoft's C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language.",
      "Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.",
      "== Use ==\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.",
      "Software is commonly built with 5 programming languages or more.Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness.",
      "When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood.",
      "However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write.",
      "The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program.",
      "On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.",
      "A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data.",
      "A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation.",
      "These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called primitives).",
      "Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.",
      "Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter.",
      "In this case the \"commands\" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together.",
      "When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language.",
      "=== Measuring language usage ===\n\nDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context.",
      "One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time.",
      "Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications.",
      "For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran in scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time and embedded applications; and C in embedded applications and operating systems.",
      "Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.",
      "Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:\n\ncounting the number of job advertisements that mention the language\nthe number of books sold that teach or describe the language\nestimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language –  which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches\ncounts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine.Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular programming languages as (in descending order by overall popularity): Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB.",
      "== Dialects, flavors and implementations ==\nA dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature.",
      "With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect.",
      "In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language, often a subset.",
      "In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, Racket and Clojure.",
      "As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation.",
      "The BASIC programming language has many dialects.",
      "The explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying \"If you've seen one Forth... you've seen one Forth.\"",
      "== Taxonomies ==\n\nThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages.",
      "A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language.",
      "Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time.",
      "Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.",
      "The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes.",
      "For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads in parallel).",
      "Python is an object-oriented scripting language.",
      "In broad strokes, programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use, with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages.",
      "Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e.",
      "issuing commands.",
      "These are generally called imperative programming languages.",
      "A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of declarative programming.",
      "More refined paradigms include procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and logic programming; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic.",
      "An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture.",
      "By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).",
      "Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm.",
      "For instance, most programming languages use English language keywords, while a minority do not.",
      "Other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric or not.",

      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.",
      "Reinforcement learning is considered as one of three machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.",
      "It differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected.",
      "Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).",
      "The environment is typically formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques.",
      "The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods  and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.",

      "In the operations research and control literature, reinforcement learning is called approximate dynamic programming, or neuro-dynamic programming.",
      "The problems of interest in reinforcement learning have also been studied in the theory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation, particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment.",

      "In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about the long term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future income), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.",
      "Thus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off.",
      "It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).",
      "Two elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments.",
      "Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:\n\nA model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;\nOnly a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\nThe only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.The first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem.",
      "However, reinforcement learning converts both planning problems to machine learning problems.",
      "== Exploration ==\nThe exploration vs. exploitation trade-off has been most thoroughly studied through the multi-armed bandit problem and in finite MDPs.Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms.",
      "Randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance.",
      "The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood.",

      "=== Lean In ===\nSandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.",
      "The book concerns business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.",
      "As of the fall of 2013, the book had sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.Lean In is intended for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society.",
      "The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.",
      "Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles.",
      "Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles.",
      "The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.",
      "A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.",
      "Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is \"too elitist\" and another that she is \"tone-deaf\" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.",
      "Sandberg mentions both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is \"acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families\" and that her intention was to \"offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook.\".",
      "Furthermore, following the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal, Sandberg's willingness to actually lean in has been put into question. \"",
      "'She's not leaning in at all,\" McNamee said, in a reference Sandberg's widely read book published five years ago.",
      "\"If ever there was a time for her to lean in, this is it.'",
      "\" In her book, she does suggest other women to lean in during challenges.",
      "...we're failing to encourage women to aspire to leadership.",
      "It is time to cheer on girls and women who want to sit at the table, seek challenges, and lean in to their careers.",
      "Instead, she has been perceived as a COO who avoids engaging in this crisis.",
      "\"Sandberg, the architect of the business model that is now the subject of so much scrutiny, has remained silent in public.\"",
      "In her book she recognizes those who do tackle crises:\n\nI have the deepest respect for people who provide hands-on help to those in crises.",
      "It is the most difficult work in the world.",
      "=== Option B ===\nSandberg released her second book, Option B, in April 2017.",
      "Option B is co-authored with Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.",

      "In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo!",
      "and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.",
      "The couple has a son and a daughter.",
      "Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.",
      "Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly, and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill, while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.",
      "Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia, and not due to falling from a treadmill.Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.",
      "=== Politics ===\nSandberg supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Sandberg’s belief that women can always “have it all” is “a lie”.",

    "topic": "Silicon Valley",
    "content": [
      "Silicon Valley is a region in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California that serves as a global center for high technology, innovation and social media.",
      "It corresponds roughly to the geographical Santa Clara Valley.",
      "San Jose is the Valley's largest city, the third largest in California, and the tenth largest in the United States.",
      "Other major Silicon Valley cities include Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Cupertino, Santa Clara, Mountain View, and Sunnyvale.",
      "The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third highest GDP per capita in the world (after Zurich, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution.The word \"silicon\" in the name originally referred to the large number of silicon chip innovators and manufacturers in the region, but the area is now home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, including the headquarters of 39 businesses in the Fortune 1000, and thousands of startup companies.",
      "Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation and scientific development.",
      "It was in the Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the microcomputer, among other technologies, were developed.",
      "As of 2013, the region employed about a quarter of a million information technology workers.As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, San Francisco and Oakland, the \"Silicon Valley\" has come to have two definitions: a geographic one, referring to Santa Clara County, and a metonymical one, referring to all high-tech businesses in the Bay Area.",
      "The term is now generally used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector.",
      "The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired similar named locations, as well as research parks and technology centers with a comparable structure all around the world.",
      "== Origin of the term ==\nThe popularization of the name is credited to Don Hoefler, who first used it in the article \"Silicon Valley USA\", appearing in the January 11, 1971 issue of the weekly trade newspaper Electronic News.",
      "The term gained widespread use in the early 1980s, at the time of the introduction of the IBM PC and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.",
      "== History (pre-1970's) ==\n\nSilicon Valley was born through several contributing factors intersecting, including a skilled STEM research base housed in area universities, plentiful venture capital, and steady U.S. Department of Defense spending.",
      "Stanford University leadership was especially important in the valley's early development.",
      "Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success.",
      "=== Military technology roots ===\n\nOn August 23, 1899, the first ship-to-shore wireless telegraph message to be received in the US was from the San Francisco lightship outside the Golden Gate, signaling the return of the American fleet from the Philippines after their victory in the Spanish–American War.",
      "The ship had been outfitted with a wireless telegraph transmitter by a local newspaper, so that they could prepare a celebration on the return of the American sailors.",
      "Local historian Clyde Arbuckle states in Clyde Arbuckle's History of San Jose that \"California first heard the click of a telegraph key on September 11, 1853.",
      "It marked completion of an enterprise begun by a couple of San Francisco Merchants' Exchange members named George Sweeney and Theodore E. Baugh…\"  He says, \"In 1849, the gentleman established a wigwag telegraph station a top a high hill overlooking Portsmouth Squares for signaling arriving ships… The operator at the first station caught these signals by telescope and relayed them to the Merchant's Exchange for the waiting business community.\"",
      "Arbuckle points to the historic significance the Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco) and Telegraph Hill, San Francisco when he goes on to say \"The first station gave the name Telegraph to the hill on which it was located.",
      "It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.",
      "Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire.\"",
      "According to Arbuckle (p. 380–381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E.",
      "Allen and C. Burnham led the way to \"build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento.\"",
      "Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, \"…San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.",
      "The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24.\"",
      "The Bay Area had long been a major site of United States Navy research and technology.",
      "In 1909, Charles Herrold started the first radio station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in San Jose.",
      "Later that year, Stanford University graduate Cyril Elwell purchased the U.S. patents for Poulsen arc radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in Palo Alto.",
      "Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.In 1933, Air Base Sunnyvale, California, was commissioned by the United States Government for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship USS Macon in Hangar One.",
      "The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there.",
      "A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy.",
      "When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to San Diego, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA) took over portions of Moffett Field for aeronautics research.",
      "Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in.",
      "The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms, such as Lockheed.",
      "Ham radioThe Bay Area was an early center of ham radio with about 10% of the operators in the United States.",
      "William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and Charles Litton, who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay Area, were hobbyists with training in technology gained locally who participated in the development of shortwave radio by the ham radio hobby.",
      "High frequency, and especially, Very high frequency, VHF, transmission in the 10-meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse which controlled vacuum tube manufacture.",
      "Litton, founder of Litton Industries, pioneered manufacturing techniques which resulted in the award of wartime contracts to manufacture transmitting tubes for radar to Eitel-McCullough, a San Bruno firm, which manufactured power-grid tubes for radio amateurs and aircraft radio equipment.",
      "Welfare capitalismA union organizing drive in 1939–40 at Eitel-McCullough by the strong Bay Area labor movement was fought off by adoption of a strategy of welfare capitalism which included pensions and other generous benefits, profit sharing, and such extras as a medical clinic and a cafeteria.",
      "An atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration was established.",
      "Successes have been few and far between for union organizing drives by UE and others in subsequent years.",
      "U.S. response to SputnikOn October 4, 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first space satellite, Sputnik, which sparked fear that the Soviet Union was pulling ahead technologically.",
      "After President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA), he turned to Fairchild Semiconductor, then the only company in the world that was able to make transistors.",
      "The president funded Fairchild's project, which was highly successful.",
      "=== Stanford University ===\nStanford University, its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of this area.",
      "Some examples include the work of Lee De Forest with his invention of a pioneering vacuum tube called the Audion and the oscilloscopes of Hewlett-Packard.",
      "A very powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley.",
      "From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly.",
      "At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry.",
      "Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development.During the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, as Stanford's dean of engineering and provost, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies.",
      "He is credited with nurturing Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford campus.",
      "Terman is often called \"the father of Silicon Valley\".In 1956, William Shockley, the creator of the transistor, moved from New Jersey to Mountain View, California, to start Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in Palo Alto.",
      "Shockley's work served as the basis for many electronic developments for decades.During 1955–85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC.",
      "In 1969, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet.",
      "Stanford Industrial ParkAfter World War II, universities were experiencing enormous demand due to returning students.",
      "To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, Frederick Terman proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the Stanford Industrial Park (later Stanford Research Park) in the year 1951.",
      "Leases were limited to high technology companies.",
      "Its first tenant was Varian Associates, founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components.",
      "However, Terman also found venture capital for civilian technology start-ups.",
      "One of the major success stories was Hewlett-Packard.",
      "Founded in Packard's garage by Stanford graduates William Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953.",
      "In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis.",
      "The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.",
      "Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand ink jet printer in 1984.",
      "Other early tenants included Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed.",
      "=== Silicon transistor ===\nIn 1953, William Shockley left Bell Labs in a disagreement over the handling of the invention of the transistor.",
      "After returning to California Institute of Technology for a short while, Shockley moved to Mountain View, California, in 1956, and founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory.",
      "Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors.",
      "Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the Shockley diode), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor.",
      "In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor.",
      "As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form Fairchild Semiconductor; Shockley referred to them as the \"traitorous eight\".",
      "Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, would go on to found Intel.",
      "=== Computer networking ===\nOn April 23, 1963, J.C.R.",
      "Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at The Pentagon's ARPA issued an office memorandum addressed to Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network.",
      "It rescheduled a meeting in Palo Alto regarding his vision of a computer network which he imagined as an electronic commons open to all the main and essential medium of informational interaction for governments, institutions, corporations, and individuals.",
      "As head of IPTO from 1962 to 1964, \"Licklider initiated three of the most important developments in information technology: the creation of computer science departments at several major universities, time-sharing, and networking.” By the late 1960s, his promotion of the concept had inspired a primitive version of his vision called ARPANET, which expanded into a network of networks in the 1970s that became the Internet.",
      "=== Immigration reform ===\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and other factors such as the mass exodus by Vietnamese boat people resulted in significant immigration, particularly by Asians, Latinos, and Portuguese, to Silicon Valley where they contributed to both the high-tech and production workforce.",
      "The Asian-American population in Santa Clara County rose from 43,000 in 1970 to 430,000 in 2000.",
      "During the same period the Latino population grew to 24% in the county and 30% in San Jose.",
      "The African-American population in the county remained steady but grew slightly to about 5%.",
      "Expansion of the H-1B visa in 1990 also played a role.",
      "== History (since 1971) ==\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced patent attorneys whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.",
      "During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the Peninsula to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.",
      "One sign of the rapid expansion of Silicon Valley legal services was that Palo Alto law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati \"expanded from a dozen attorneys in 1975 to more than 700 by 2000.\"",
      "=== Computer chips ===\n\nIn April 1974, Intel released the Intel 8080, a \"computer on a chip\", \"the first truly usable microprocessor\".",
      "A microprocessor incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC).",
      "Homebrew Computer Club\n\nThe Homebrew Computer Club was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of computing devices.",
      "It was started by Gordon French and Fred Moore who met at the Community Computer Center in Menlo Park.",
      "They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.The first meeting was held as of March 1975 at French's garage in Menlo Park, San Mateo County, California; which was on occasion of the arrival of the MITS Altair microcomputer, the first unit sent to the area for review by People's Computer Company.",
      "Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs credit that first meeting with inspiring them to design the original Apple I and (successor) Apple II computers.",
      "As a result, the first preview of the Apple I was given at the Homebrew Computer Club.",
      "Subsequent meetings were held at an auditorium at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.",
      "=== Venture capital ===\nBy the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies in the area, computer firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both.",
      "Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive.",
      "Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of venture capital on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3 billion IPO of Apple Computer in December 1980.",
      "In 1971 Don Hoefler traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from  Fairchild's eight co-founders.",
      "The key investors in Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were from the same group, directly leading to Tech Crunch 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.",
      "=== Software ===\nAlthough semiconductors are still a major component of the area's economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and Internet services.",
      "Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, software, and user interfaces.",
      "Using money from NASA, the US Air Force, and ARPA, Doug Engelbart invented the mouse and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as The Mother of All Demos.",
      "Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center at SRI was also involved in launching the ARPANET (precursor to the Internet) and starting the Network Information Center (now InterNIC).",
      "Xerox hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s.",
      "In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) played a pivotal role in object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), Ethernet, PostScript, and laser printers.",
      "While Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere.",
      "The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to 3Com and Adobe Systems, and indirectly to Cisco, Apple Computer, and Microsoft.",
      "Apple's Macintosh GUI was largely a result of Steve Jobs' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.",
      "Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over Stanford University's Ethernet campus network.",
      "=== Internet age ===\n\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.",
      "In 1995, commercial use of the Internet grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, Amazon.com, eBay, and the predecessor to Craigslist began operations.",
      "==== Dot-com bubble ====\n\nSilicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the dot-com bubble, which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the NASDAQ stock market began to decline dramatically in April 2000.",
      "During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels.",
      "For a brief time, Sand Hill Road was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe traffic congestion.",
      "==== 21st century ====\nAfter the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world.",
      "A 2006 The Wall Street Journal story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley.",
      "San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents.",
      "Silicon Valley is also home to a significant number of \"Unicorn\" ventures, referring to startup companies whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion dollars.",
      "== Economy ==\n\nSilicon Valley has a social and business ethos that supports innovation and entrepreneurship.",
      "Attempts to create \"Silicon Valleys\" in environments where disruptive innovation does not go over well have a poor track record.The San Francisco Bay Area has the largest concentration of high-tech companies in the United States, at 387,000 high-tech jobs, of which Silicon Valley accounts for 225,300 high-tech jobs.",
      "Silicon Valley has the highest concentration of high-tech workers of any metropolitan area, with 285.9 out of every 1,000 private-sector workers.",
      "Silicon Valley has the highest average high-tech salary in the United States at $144,800.",
      "Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita.",
      "The region is the biggest high-tech manufacturing center in the United States.",
      "The unemployment rate of the region was 9.4% in January 2009, up from 7.8% in the previous month.",
      "Silicon Valley received 41% of all U.S. venture investment in 2011, and 46% in 2012.",
      "More traditional industries also recognize the potential of high-tech development, and several car manufacturers have opened offices in Silicon Valley to capitalize on its entrepreneurial ecosystem.",

      "As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.",
      "Mona Simpson, Jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: \"it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim.",
      "But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "So it's not that unusual.\"",
      "Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's official biographer, additionally states that Schieble's father \"threatened to cut Joanne off completely\" if she continued the relationship.Jobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922–1993), grew up in a Calvinist household, the son of an \"alcoholic and sometimes abusive\" father.",
      "The family lived on a farm in Germantown, Wisconsin.",
      "Paul bore an ostensible resemblance to James Dean; he had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the Midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work.",
      "He eventually joined the United States Coast Guard as an engine-room machinist.",
      "After World War II, Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when his ship docked in San Francisco.",
      "He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (1924–1986).",
      "They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946.",
      "Clara, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war.",
      "After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in San Francisco's Sunset District in 1952.",
      "As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but his career was as a \"repo man\", which suited his \"aggressive, tough personality.\"",

      "=== Birth ===\n\nSchieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs, Syria.",
      "Jandali has stated that he \"was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria.",
      "And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption.\"",
      "Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both believed that at 23 they were too young to marry.",
      "In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954.",
      "According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: \"without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone.\"",
      "Schieble put herself in the care of a \"doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions.",

      "The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead.",
      "The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.",
      "She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college.",
      "When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she \"was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life ...",

      "Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that \"he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents.\"",
      "Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as \"adoptive parents\" as they \"were my parents 1,000%.\"",
      "With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as \"my sperm and egg bank.",
      "That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.\"",
      "Jandali has also stated that \"I really am not his dad.",

      "I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad.\"",
      "By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.",
      "He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a \"loner.\"",
      "Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was suspended a few times.",
      "Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was \"pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher.\"",
      "He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View.",
      "His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene \"Teddy\" Hill, with turning him around: \"She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation.",
      "She bribed me into learning.",
      "She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook.",
      "I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.'",
      "That really kindled a passion in me for learning things!",
      "I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school.",
      "They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen.\"",
      "Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a \"socially awkward loner\".",
      "Jobs \"was often bullied\" and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.",
      "Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, which would allow Jobs to change schools.",
      "The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View home.",
      "The house was declared a historic site in 2013 as it was the first site for Apple Computer and is now owned by Patty and occupied by Jobs's step-mother Marilyn.When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project: \"He didn't know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters...well, assembling may be too strong.",
      "I was putting in screws.",
      "It didn't matter; I was in heaven.",
      "\"Bill Fernandez, a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in Jobs's grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the 1967 move.",
      "Fernandez later commented that \"for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn't like [Jobs] because they thought he was odd.",
      "I was one of his few friends.\"",
      "Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alum Steve Wozniak, who lived across the street from Fernandez.",
      "== Homestead High ==\nThe location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley.",

      "Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM, and thus \"the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market.\"",

      "Although its products provided 85 percent of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees.",
      "Many left including Wozniak, who stated that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stock.",
      "The Macintosh's failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley's position in the company.",
      "In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of \"New Product Development\".",
      "This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.",

      "In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to \"just explain it to them until they understand\" in disagreements.",
      "Catmull released the book Creativity, Inc. in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs.",
      "Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs, Catmull writes:\nIn all the 26 years with Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it's not my nature to do that.",
      "... but we did disagree fairly frequently about things.",
      "I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could.",
      "I would then wait a week ...",
      "I'd call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he'd immediately shoot it down.",
      "So I had to wait another week, and sometimes this went on for months.",
      "But in the end one of three things happened.",
      "About a third of the time he said, 'Oh, I get it, you're right.'",
      "And that was the end of it.",
      "And it was another third of the time in which [I'd] say, 'Actually I think he is right.'",
      "The other third of the time, where we didn't reach consensus, he just let me do it my way, never said anything more about it.",
      "=== Family ===\n\nChrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, \"he apologized many times over for his behavior\" towards her and Lisa.",
      "She also states that Jobs \"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\".",

      "Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however.",
      "He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson: \"I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out.\"",
      "However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer.",
      "He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother.",
      "Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant.",
      "Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death.",
      "As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that \"his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble\".Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died and after he received permission from his father, Paul.",
      "In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.",
      "Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need \"to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion.",
      "She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.\"",
      "Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers.",
      "She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it.",
      "Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.",
      "Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked.",
      "Her first impression of Jobs was that \"he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy.\"",
      "Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.",
      "Jobs later told his biographer that \"Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me .",
      "As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family.",
      "I don't know what I'd do without her.",
      "I can't imagine a better sister.",
      "My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close.\"",
      "Jobs then learned his family history.",
      "Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.",
      "Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962).",
      "He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years.",
      "We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year.",
      "I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.",
      "A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson.",
      "Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name and thus became Mona Simpson.",

      "Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business.",

      "That baby's gone.\"",
      "Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs.",
      "Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that \"all of the successful technology people used to come there.",
      "Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper.\"",
      "After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that \"it was amazing ....",
      "I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner.",
      "He was Syrian.",
      "Balding.",
      "We shook hands.\"",
      "However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because \"I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ...",
      "I asked Mona not to tell him about me.\"",
      "Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog.",
      "He then contacted Simpson and asked \"what is this thing about Steve Jobs?\"",
      "Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, \"My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ...",
      "He never contacted Steve.\"",
      "Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.",
      "Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.",
      "Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father.",

      "After she received her BA from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead.",

      "=== Apple Lisa ===\n\nThe Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple during the early 1980s.",
      "It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users.",
      "Development of the Lisa began in 1978.",
      "The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the Macintosh project.",
      "The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems.",
      "The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.",
      "=== Macintosh ===\n\nOnce he joined the original Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company.",
      "Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984.",
      "This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.",
      "This first model was later renamed to \"Macintosh 128k\" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture.",
      "Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of \"Mac\", though the product family has been nicknamed \"Mac\" or \"the Mac\" since the development of the first model.",
      "The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, \"1984\".",
      "It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and some people consider the ad a \"watershed event\" and a \"masterpiece\".",
      "Regis McKenna called the ad \"more successful than the Mac itself\".",
      "\"1984\" uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the conformity of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry.",
      "The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"Big Brother.",
      "\"The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.",
      "Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.",
      "=== NeXT Computer ===\n\nAfter Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started a company that built workstation computers.",
      "The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event.",
      "Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser (WorldWideWeb) using the NeXT Computer.",
      "The NeXT Computer was the basis for today's macOS (formerly OS X) and iOS (formerly iPhone OS).",
      "=== iMac ===\n\nApple iMac was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple.",
      "Apple boasted \"the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's.\"",
      "Described as \"cartoonlike\", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before.",
      "In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design.",
      "Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep.",
      "The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time.",
      "The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs.",
      "This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).",
      "=== iTunes ===\n\niTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple.",
      "It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.",
      "The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.",
      "Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward).",
      "Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.",
      "=== iPod ===\n\nThe first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001.",
      "The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8\" hard drive compared to the 2.5\" drives common to players at that time.",
      "The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.",
      "The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001.",
      "The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.",
      "Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.",
      "After the 1st generation of iPod, Apple released the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, the video-capable iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.",
      "=== iPhone ===\n\nApple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.",
      "The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release.",
      "Time declared it \"Invention of the Year\" for 2007.",
      "The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone.",

      "Nikola Tesla (; Serbo-Croatian: [nǐkola têsla]; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.",
      "He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he would become a naturalized citizen.",
      "He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own.",
      "With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.",
      "His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.",
      "Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.",
      "He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.",
      "Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.",
      "Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs.",
      "In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.",
      "Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.",
      "Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.",
      "He died in New York City in January 1943.",
      "Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.",
      "There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.",
      "== Early years ==\n\nNikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S.",
      "28 June] 1856.",
      "His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was an Eastern Orthodox priest.",
      "Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić; 1822–1892), whose father was also an Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems.",
      "Đuka had never received a formal education.",
      "Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.",
      "Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.Tesla was the fourth of five children.",
      "He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five.",
      "In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.",
      "In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish priest.",
      "Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school.",
      "In 1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium.",
      "The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.",
      "Tesla would later write that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.",
      "Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this \"mysterious phenomena\" made him want \"to know more of this wonderful force\".",
      "Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.",
      "He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.In 1873, Tesla returned to Smiljan.",
      "Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times.",
      "Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood) promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.In 1874, Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac.",
      "There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb.",
      "Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.",
      "He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship.",
      "During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required), started a Serb cultural club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\"",
      "During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators were not necessary.",
      "Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.",
      "He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\"",
      "After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would die through overwork.",
      "At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.",
      "During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.",
      "Tesla said that he \"conquered [his] passion then and there,\" but later in the US he was again known to play billiards.",
      "When examination time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied.",
      "He did not receive grades for the last semester of the third year and he never graduated from the university.",
      "In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school.",
      "His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River.",
      "Tesla moved to Maribor, where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month.",
      "He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.In March 1879, Tesla's father went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but he refused.",
      "Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown around the same time.",
      "On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit.",
      "On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness.",
      "Some sources say that he died of a stroke.",
      "During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study.",
      "He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject.",
      "Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.",
      "=== Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange ===\nIn 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.",
      "Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead.",
      "Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.",
      "During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.",
      "== Working at Edison ==\nIn 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.",
      "Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in the form of an electric power utility.",
      "The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system.",
      "There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering.",
      "Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.",
      "They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.",
      "=== Move to the United States ===\n\nIn 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well.",
      "In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States.",
      "He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.",
      "As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators.",
      "Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.",
      "One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night.",
      "After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\".",
      "One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system.",
      "Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well.",
      "Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.",
      "What event precipitated his leaving is unclear.",
      "It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.",
      "Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.",
      "In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but it turned out to be a practical joke\".",
      "Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"Tesla, you don't understand our American humor\".",
      "The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that amount of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand.",
      "Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good by to the Edison Machine Works\".",
      "== Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing ==\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.",
      "In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.",
      "Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.",
      "Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.",
      "The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment.",
      "After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility.",
      "They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless.",
      "Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock.",
      "He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day.",
      "Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery\".",
      "== AC and the induction motor ==\n\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck.",
      "The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.",
      "Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents.",
      "Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development.",
      "They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.",
      "In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.",
      "The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).",
      "This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent with the issue of the patent.",
      "Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.",
      "Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing.",
      "Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.",
      "In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.",
      "Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($55,800 in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars.",
      "He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power.",
      "Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed.",
      "They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.",
      "=== Market turmoil ===\nTesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies.",
      "The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other.",
      "There was even a \"War of Currents\" propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system.",
      "Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble.",
      "The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to W.E (Westinghouse Electric).",
      "The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts.",
      "The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract.",
      "At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development.",
      "Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer.",
      "In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties.",
      "The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract.",
      "Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).",
      "== New York laboratories ==\n\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests.",
      "In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years would work out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.",
      "These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902).",
      "Tesla and his hired staff would conduct some of his most significant work in these workshops.",
      "=== Tesla coil ===\n\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz' 1886–88 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.",
      "Tesla found this new discovery \"refreshing\" and decided to explore it more fully.",
      "In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments, Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil.",
      "To fix this problem Tesla came up with his Tesla coil with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.",
      "=== Citizenship ===\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.",
      "In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.",
      "=== Wireless lighting ===\n\nAfter 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil.",
      "He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage.",
      "He would spend most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting it through the Earth.Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).",
      "=== Steam-powered oscillating generator ===\n\nTrying to come up with a better way to generate alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator.",
      "He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year.",
      "Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature.",
      "The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field.",
      "This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent.",
      "It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.",
      "=== Polyphase System and the Columbian Exposition ===\n\nAt the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor, and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\".",
      "They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other AC systems.Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits.",
      "Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system.",
      "Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.An observer noted:\n\nWithin the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil.",
      "These were about fifteen feet apart, and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers.",
      "When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous.",
      "These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, \"where they produced so much wonder and astonishment\".",
      "Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end, using a device that he constructed known as the Egg of Columbus and introduced his new steam powered oscillator AC generator.",
      "=== Consulting on Niagara ===\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls.",
      "Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls.",
      "Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air.",
      "Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems.",
      "Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current.",
      "The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system.",
      "At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.",
      "=== The Nikola Tesla Company ===\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones.",
      "Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown.",
      "The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.",
      "It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out.",
      "The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.",
      "=== Lab fire ===\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire.",
      "It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor.",
      "The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition.",
      "Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk.",
      "What can I say?\"",
      "After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.",
      "=== X-ray experimentation ===\n\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\").",
      "His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube.",
      "Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.",
      "The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.",
      "In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation).",
      "In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays.",
      "Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices.",
      "In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes.",
      "He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid.",
      "Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas.",
      "These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:\n\nTesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out.",
      "In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his \"electric gun,\" Tesla said, \"The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations\".",
      "=== Radio remote control ===\nIn 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.",
      "The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.",
      "Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.",
      "Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs.",
      "Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.",
      "== Wireless power ==\n\nFrom the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires.",
      "It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting.",
      "He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.",
      "At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power.",
      "Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect.",
      "Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile.",
      "Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of \"invisible light\" would diminish over distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming \"hopelessly lost\".By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab.",
      "Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.",
      "=== Colorado Springs ===\n\nTo further study the conductive nature of low pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.",
      "There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge.",
      "To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,011,600 in today's dollars) to become a majority share holder in the Nikola Tesla Company.",
      "Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system.",
      "Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.",
      "Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.",
      "There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet (41 m) in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage.",
      "The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to (incorrectly) conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.",
      "During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet.",
      "He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900.",
      "Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars.",
      "He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article entitled \"Talking With Planets\", where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could come have from Mars, Venus, or other planets.",
      "It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings.",
      "The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there.",
      "The article, titled \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine.",
      "He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.",
      "=== Wardenclyffe ===\n\nTesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria's Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico's.",
      "In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($4,517,400 in today's dollars) from J. Pierpont Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own.",
      "He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds.",
      "In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission.",
      "A month after Marconi's success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\".",
      "Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.",
      "Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902.",
      "The tower was erected to its full height of 187 feet (57 m).",
      "In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax.",
      "The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part.",
      "Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($500,300 in today's dollars).",
      "He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.",
      "== Later years ==\nAfter Wardencyiffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project.",
      "In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents.",
      "He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925.",
      "After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt.",
      "Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.",
      "=== Bladeless turbine ===\n\nOn his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.",
      "During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.",
      "Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919–1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers.",
      "He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device.",
      "Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.",
      "=== Wireless lawsuits ===\nWhen World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries.",
      "They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement.",
      "Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month.",
      "The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents.",
      "Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents.",
      "Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla.",
      "The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.",
      "=== Nobel Prize rumors ===\nOn 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg \"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\".",
      "There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize.",
      "The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937).",
      "=== Other ideas, awards, and patents ===\nTesla won numerous medals and awards over this time.",
      "They include:\n\nOrder of St. Sava, II Class, Government of Serbia (1892)\nElliott Cresson Medal (1894)\nOrder of Prince Danilo I (1895)\nAIEE Edison Medal (1917)\nOrder of St. Sava, I Class, Government of Yugoslavia (1926)\nOrder of the Yugoslav Crown (1931)\nJohn Scott Medal (1934)\nOrder of the White Eagle, I Class, Government of Yugoslavia (1936)\nOrder of the White Lion, I Class, Government of Czechoslovakia (1937)\nUniversity of Paris Medal (1937)\nThe Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida, Sofia, Bulgaria (1939)\nTesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone.",
      "These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel.",
      "He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence.",
      "In 1912, he crafted \"a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,\" wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, \"saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency.",
      "The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'\"",
      "The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors.",
      "After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.",
      "In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar).",
      "Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water.",
      "Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct.",
      "Girardeau said, \"(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly\".In 1928, Tesla received U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then of being \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.",
      "Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000, although the aircraft has been described as impractical.",
      "This would be his last patent and at this time Tesla closed his last office at 350 Madison Ave., which he had moved into two years earlier.",
      "=== Living circumstances ===\nSince 1900, Tesla had been living at the Waldorf Astoria in New York running up a large bill.",
      "In 1922, he moved to St. Regis Hotel and would follow a pattern from then on of moving to a new hotel every few years leaving behind unpaid bills.Tesla would walk to the park every day to feed the pigeons.",
      "He took to feeding them at the window of his hotel room and bringing the injured ones in to nurse back to health.",
      "He said that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily.",
      "Tesla spent over $2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg.",
      "Tesla stated:\n\nI have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years.",
      "But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different.",
      "It was a female.",
      "I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me.",
      "I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me.",
      "As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.",
      "Tesla's unpaid bills, and complaints about the mess from his pigeon-feeding, forced him to leave the St. Regis in 1923, the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930, and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934.",
      "At one point, he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.In 1934, Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker, and Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 per month as well as paying his rent, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life.",
      "Accounts of how this came about vary.",
      "Several sources say Westinghouse was worried (or warned) about potential bad publicity surrounding the impoverished conditions under which their former star inventor was living.",
      "The payment has been described as being couched as a \"consulting fee\" to get around Tesla's aversion to accept charity, or by one biographer (Marc Seifer) as a type of unspecified settlement.",
      "=== Birthday press conferences ===\n\nIn 1931, a young science fiction writer whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday.",
      "Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine.",
      "The cover caption \"All the world's his power house\" noted his contribution to electrical power generation.",
      "The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink featuring dishes of his own creation, to invite the press to see his inventions and hear stories about past exploits and views on current events, including sometimes odd or baffling claims.",
      "At the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.In 1933 at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after thirty-five years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy.",
      "He claimed it was a theory of energy that was \"violently opposed\" to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years.",
      "He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war.",
      "He would call it \"teleforce\", but was usually referred to as his death ray.",
      "Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft.",
      "Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime, but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade.",
      "The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion).",
      "Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.In 1935 at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics.",
      "He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator.",
      "Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in downtown New York City in 1898.",
      "He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure.",
      "He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called \"Telegeodynamics\", using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In his 1937 Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the \"Order of the White Lion\" from the Czechoslovakia ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslavian ambassador.",
      "On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, \"But it is not an experiment ...",
      "I have built, demonstrated and used it.",
      "Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.\"",
      "== Death ==\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons.",
      "While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground.",
      "His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident.",
      "The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.",

      "In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ...",
      "The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me\".",

      "When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:\n\nHe had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor.",
      "But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.",
      "=== Beliefs ===\n\n\n==== On experimental and theoretical physics ====\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge.",
      "He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity.",
      "Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way.",
      "He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive \"ether\" that transmitted electrical energy.Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.",
      "He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:\n\nI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties.",
      "It might as well be said that God has properties.",
      "He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making.",
      "Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space.",
      "To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing.",
      "I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.",
      "Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\".",
      "He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.",
      "Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.",
      "==== On society ====\n\nTesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook on top of his gifts as a technological scientist.",
      "This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.",
      "Tesla expressed the belief that human \"pity\" had come to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\".",
      "Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics.",
      "In a 1937 interview he stated:\n\n... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature.",
      "The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ...",
      "The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult.",
      "Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny.",
      "A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.",
      "In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by \"Queen Bees\".",
      "He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" (20 December 1914).",
      "Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.",
      "==== On religion ====\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian.",
      "Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense,\" said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance\".",
      "He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body.",
      "When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise\".",
      "== Literary works ==\nTesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals.",
      "Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.",
      "Many of Tesla's writings are freely available online, including the article \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,\" published in The Century Magazine in 1900, and the article \"Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency,\" published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.",

      "This led her to write a blog post urging technology companies to disclose the numbers of women they had in technical roles.",
      "To facilitate sharing of the responses she received, Chou set up a repository on code-sharing site GitHub which allows anyone to submit a pull request.",
      "Within a week, the repository had statistics on over 50 firms, and by January 2016, it had statistics on 250 firms.",
      "Chou's focus on the issue is also credited with pressuring larger companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to release diversity reports.",
      "In July 2014, Chou published an update on Pinterest's engineering blog describing the company's progress so far on diversity and inclusion.Chou has identified a number of possible reasons for the disparity in representation of women in technology.",
      "She has argued that if nobody suggests to a woman that a career as a software engineer is a realistic possibility, she is less likely to consider it.",
      "She also thinks that networking opportunities and role models are more limited for women and minorities.",
      "Chou has also stated that condescending attitudes toward women are pervasive in Silicon Valley.",

      "Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility.",

      "In November 2017, the company suspended the verification process and announced plans to refine it in response to backlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler had his account verified on Twitter.Verified status allows access to some features unavailable to other users, such as only seeing mentions from other verified accounts.In a March 8, 2018 live-stream on Twitter's Periscope, Dorsey discussed the idea of allowing any user to get a verified account.",

      "== Technology ==\n\n\n=== Implementation ===\nTwitter places great reliance on open-source software.",
      "The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework, deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting).",
      "After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.From Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling.",
      "Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala.",
      "The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host.",
      "This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch.",
      "The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake, and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'.",
      "The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL.",
      "Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent.",
      "Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API.",
      "The process is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.On August 16, 2013, Raffi Krikorian, Twitter's vice president of platform engineering, shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record.",
      "Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.The service's application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter.",
      "=== Interface ===\nOn April 30, 2009, Twitter adjusted its Web interface, adding a search bar and a sidebar of \"trending topics\"—the most common phrases appearing in messages.",
      "Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that \"with this newly launched feature, Twitter has become something unexpectedly important – a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now.",

      "A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith.",
      "Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing.",
      "The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account.",
      "Within a few weeks of this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.On January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a dictionary attack.",

      "The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites.",
      "The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets.",

      "This led to the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy and the \"super-injunction\".",
      "Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do \"bad things\" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so.",
      "He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for \"illegal activity\" on the site.Twitter acquired Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses, in January 2012.",

      "Twitter also offered a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country, before deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries.",
      "The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18, 2012.",

      "Twitter disputed the claim, stating that \"violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.\"",
      "The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, upholding the Section 230 safe harbor, which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users.",
      "The lawsuit was revised in August 2016, providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices.Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics in May 2016, sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech.",
      "Following public outcry, Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had been suspended.",
      "The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review \"[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech\" posted on their services within 24 hours.",
      "In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned 235,000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism.In October 2017, actress Rose McGowan said that Twitter had suspended her account for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted about former film studio executive Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct toward her and others.",
      "Twitter explained that McGowan's account had violated its privacy policy because one of her tweets included a private phone number.",
      "According to The New York Times, \"Many Twitter users expressed outrage over Ms. McGowan's account being locked\".",
      "After the tweet was removed, her account was unlocked several hours before the 12-hour ban was set to expire.",
      "A Twitter representative stated, \"We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future.\"",
      "Later that day, software engineer Kelly Ellis, using the hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter, urged women to shun Twitter for 24 hours, beginning at midnight, in solidarity with McGowan and, tweeted Ellis, \"all the victims of hate and harassment Twitter fails to support.\"",
      "The boycott was joined by activists, celebrities and journalists.In November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Twitter is among the corporations that avoided paying taxes by using offshore companies.",
      "Later The New York Times reported that Russian-American billionaire Yuri Milner had strong Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\n\nTwitter is banned completely in Iran, China and North Korea, and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Turkey and Venezuela on different bases.",
      "In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel.",
      "In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany.",
      "As part of evidence to a US Senate Enquiry, the company admitted that their systems \"detected and hid\" several hundred thousand tweets relating to the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak.",
      "==== Trending topics ====\nAfter claims in the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site's list of trending topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.In 2016, at the same time as Twitter executives paid to attend a political fundraiser by Hillary Clinton, the Twitter platform banned a pro-Bernie Sanders account that had started a hashtag critical of Clinton's fundraising from wealthy donors.",
      "==== Trust & Safety Council ====\nThe announcement of Twitter's \"Trust & Safety Council\" was met with objection from parts of its userbase.",
      "Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards \"the restriction of hate speech\" and a Reason article expressed concern that \"there’s not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list\".",
      "=== Ownership ===\nIn 2016, a campaign to turn Twitter into a platform cooperative owned democratically by the users was launched.",
      "The campaign attracted over 5 000 shareholders and a proposal to transform the company into an user owned cooperative was put forth in the annual shareholder meeting.",
      "4.9% of shareholder voted in favor of our proposal.There was also an attempt by former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson to crowdfund enough money to buy Twitter and remove Donald Trump from the platform.",
      "=== Impact ===\n\n\n==== Instant, short, and frequent communication ====\nIn May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter \"elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters.",
      "Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends.",
      "But some users are starting to feel too connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner.\"",
      "The following year, John C. Dvorak described Twitter as \"the new CB radio\".",
      "==== Emergency use ====\nA practical use for Twitter's real-time functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news.",
      "It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter's ability to track epidemics and how they spread.In addition, Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires.",
      "==== Education ====\nTwitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities.",
      "It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions, especially in large-lecture courses.",
      "Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom.",
      "By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education.",
      "A broad example of a hashtag used in education is \"edchat\", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag.",
      "Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades.",
      "In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is, another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally, 93% said they use Twitter because it is free.",
      "People found that sifting through large amounts of data is challenging, however, with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible.",
      "Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates.",
      "These features help to promote education outside the classroom on a global setting where students and educators are easily able create, connect, and share knowledge.",
      "This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the class room, but virtually and around the world.",
      "==== Public figures ====\nTech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for \"literate communication\" is \"about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad\".",
      "In September 2008, the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into \"a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world\".",
      "One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis.",
      "Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that \"the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.",
      "\"The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called \"Some Contemporary Characters,\" composed entirely of tweets.In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent.",
      "Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.",
      "In 2009, Twitter won the \"Breakout of the Year\" Webby Award.",
      "During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements.",
      "In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories.",
      "On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it \"a new form of social interaction\".",
      "Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to determine the influence of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook.",
      "The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher.",
      "The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to \"stir unrest\".",
      "The service was active from 2010 to 2012.During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, tweeted \"This is for everyone\", which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.",
      "==== World leaders ====\nWorld leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens.",
      "US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy.",
      "He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.",
      "On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition.",
      "A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts.",
      "The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers.",
      "However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.Donald Trump has used Twitter as a method of providing ideas and information during his presidential campaign in 2016, the transitional period and as US President.",
      "A study performed at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets, the professors found that President Trump uses a mode called \"forensic mode\" the most often in his tweets.",
      "This is described as a quick reactive usage, as they found he often used Twitter to show his judgement of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies.",
      "After his election to the presidency he tweeted this \"forensic-style\" tweet, \"Just had a very open and successful election.",
      "Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting.",
      "Very Unfair!",
      "\".In a study done at New York University in 2015, an analysis and comparison of the Twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, found observations showing the goals of each candidate's Twitter during their respective primary elections.",
      "Some comparisons that were made were the use of Aristotle's theory of Rhetoric.",
      "The research found that Donald Trump used pathos, the appeal to emotion, in his rhetoric; Bernie Sanders tended to use ethos and logos for his Twitter; Hillary Clinton tended to use logos and pathos to try to convey her values, and Jeb Bush shows that he uses a mix of all three on his account.",
      "The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election.",
      "The study found that the tweets became more persuasive for the candidates if the media put the tweets in front of more viewers, versus less powerful if they were only visible to those already on Twitter.",
      "In that way, presidential candidates who had their tweets covered more in the news were able to get their message to more potential voters.",
      "==== Religion ====\nMore than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts, nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave.",
      "Pope Benedict XVI's Twitter account was set up in 2012.",
      "As of April 2016, his successor, Pope Francis, has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).In a 2015 European Foundation for Democracy-European Policy Centre policy dialogue panel in Brussels, Mark Wallace, CEO of the \"CounterExtremism Project\" and former U.S ambassador to the United Nations, said: “Twitter is currently the ´gateway drug´ for those seeking to recruit fighters for Islamic terrorism and this must be stopped.”\n\n\n==== Twitterbot effect ====\nTwitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication.",
      "The New York Times states, \"They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs.\"",
      "The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot.",
      "The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal.",
      "Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, \"people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating them as if they were real people or real places.\"",
      "The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere.",
      "While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm.",
      "Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.In addition to content-generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers.",
      "With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity.",
      "Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability.",
      "With Twitterbots, users are able to create the illusion of \"buzz\" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms.",
      "The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real.",
      "This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter.",
      "The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike.",
      "According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.",
      "=== GCHQ ===\nAccording to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for \"automated posting of Twitter updates\", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for \"Twitter monitoring and profile collection\".",
      "== Television ==\nTwitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social.",
      "This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, \"virtual watercooler\" or social television—the practice has been called \"chatterboxing\".",
      "Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl and the MTV Video Music Awards; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.",
      "Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings, which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating.",

      "Then in February 2013, Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US$50 million to $100 million.",
      "Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab, Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands (e.g., TV shows and companies) are chatted about the most in social media.",
      "MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US$72 billion television advertising market.In May 2013, it launched Twitter Amplify—an advertising product for media and consumer brands.",
      "With Amplify, Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts, with advertisers' names and messages playing before the clip.",
      "In October 2013, Comcast announced that it had partnered with Twitter to implement its \"See It\" feature within the service, allowing posts promoting programs on selected NBCUniversal channels to contain direct links to TV Everywhere streaming to the program.",
      "On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.In an attempt to compete with Twitter's leadership in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts.",
      "It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people.",
      "In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time.",
      "Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV.",
      "However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later.",
      "These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the \"second screen\" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media.",
      "With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips.",
      "In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.In June 2014, Twitter acquired its Amplify partner in the U.S., SnappyTV.",
      "In Europe, Twitter's Amplify partner is London-based Grabyo, which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders to share video content across Facebook and Twitter.",
      "In July 2017, Twitter announced that it would wind down SnappyTV as a separate company, and integrate its features into the Media Studio suite on Twitter.",
      "== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== User accounts with large follower base ===\n\nAs of 30 January 2019, the ten Twitter accounts with the most followers were:\n\n\n=== Oldest accounts ===\nThe oldest Twitter accounts are 14 accounts that became active on March 21, 2006, all belonging to Twitter employees at the time and including @jack (Jack Dorsey), @biz (Biz Stone), and @noah (Noah Glass).",

      "== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Criticism by the taxi industry ===\nThe taxi industry has claimed that TNCs skirt regulations that apply to passenger transport and TNCs are therefore illegal taxicab operations.",
      "This has resulted in additional regulations imposed on TNCs and, in some jurisdictions, certain TNCs are banned from operating.",
      "==== Effect on values of New York City taxi medallions ====\nIn New York City, use of TNCs has reduced the value of taxi medallions, transferable permits or licenses authorizing the holder to pick up passengers for hire.",
      "After soaring in value after the Great Recession due to their perceived safety, New York City taxi medallions were again trading for around $170,000 each in 2018.",

      "=== Driver criticism of classification of independent contractors ===\nUnless otherwise required by law, TNC drivers are independent contractors and not employees.",
      "This designation may affect taxation, work hours, and overtime benefits and lawsuits have been filed by drivers alleging that they are entitled to the rights and remedies of being considered \"employees\" under employment law.",
      "In response, TNCs say they provide \"flexible and independent jobs\" for drivers.In O'Connor v. Uber Technologies, a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16, 2013, Uber drivers pleaded that according to the California Labor Code they should be classified as employees and receive reimbursement of business expenses such as gas and vehicle maintenance costs.",
      "In March 2019, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle the case.On October 28, 2016, in the case of Aslam v Uber BV, the Central London Employment tribunal ruled that Uber drivers are \"workers\", rather than self-employed individuals, and are entitled to the minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, paid holiday, and other normal worker entitlements.",

      "As a result, in some jurisdictions, such as New York City, drivers are guaranteed a minimum wage.",
      "=== Dynamic pricing ===\nTNCs use dynamic pricing models; prices for the same route vary based on the supply and demand for rides at the time the ride is requested.",
      "When rides are in high demand in a certain area and there are not enough drivers in such area, fares increase to get more drivers to that area and to reduce demand for rides in that area.",
      "The rate quoted to the rider reflects such dynamic pricing.TNCs were criticized for extreme surcharges during emergencies such as Hurricane Sandy, the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis, and the June 2017 London Bridge attack, especially when taxis offered to transport riders for free; however, in many cases, the surcharges were refunded by the TNCs and TNCs later agreed to either not charge surcharges, or in some cases, offer free rides, during certain emergencies.",
      "=== Increased traffic congestion ===\nTNCs were criticized for increasing traffic congestion in New York City and San Francisco.",
      "A report published by Schaller Consulting in July 2018 showed that traffic congestion increased as a result of TNCs.However, some reports say TNCs reduce traffic congestion; since their cars \"can't accept street hails, they do much less unnecessary driving-around than either government-licensed/regulated taxi cabs (who are cruising for hails) or individuals (who are looking for a parking spot).\"",
      "A March 2016 study by Judd Cramer and Alan Krueger of the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that a ride via a TNC uses capacity more efficiently than traditional taxicabs as TNC drivers are more likely to have a passenger than a taxicab.",
      "=== Reduced usage of public transportation ===\nStudies have shown that TNCs have led to a reduction in use of public transportation.",
      "=== Lack of wheelchair accessible vans ===\nIn some areas, TNCs are required by law to have a certain amount of wheelchair accessible vans (WAVs) on the road at any given time.",
      "This can be a difficult requirement for TNCs to meet because TNCs don't provide vehicles and most drivers do not own a WAV, causing a shortage.",
      "=== Drivers using their phones while driving ===\nWhen a customer makes a pick-up request, a driver is notified via mobile app and is provided the customer's location.",
      "The driver has approximately 15 seconds to tap the phone to accept the request.",
      "In many jurisdictions, tapping a phone while driving is against the law as it could result in distracted driving.",
      "=== Misleading drivers of potential earnings ===\nIn January 2017, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to the US government to resolve accusations by the Federal Trade Commission of having misled drivers about potential earnings.",

      "Uber agreed to pay the amounts owed plus interest.",
      "=== Driver refusal to transport a service animal ===\nIn March 2018, a lawsuit filed against Uber in the United States accused the company's drivers of not serving a woman with cerebral palsy due to her service dog, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Texas Human Resources Code.",
      "=== Criticism for collecting fares during a taxi strike ===\nIn late January 2017, Uber was targeted by GrabYourWallet for collecting fares during a taxi strike in New York City in protest of Trump travel ban Executive Order 13769.",
      "The Order had triggered a taxi strike in New York City, to which Uber responded by removing surge pricing from JFK airport, where Muslim refugees had been detained upon entry.",
      "Uber was also targeted because then-CEO Travis Kalanick joined an Economic Advisory Council with Donald Trump.",
      "A social media campaign known as #deleteuber was formed in protest, resulting in approximately 200,000 users deleting the app.",
      "Uber added user account deletion to meet the resulting surge in requests.",
      "Statements were e-mailed to former users who had deleted their accounts, asserting that the company would assist refugees, and that CEO Kalanick joining the Council was not an endorsement of President Trump.",
      "On February 2, 2017, Kalanick resigned from the business advisory council.",
      "=== Aggressive strategy for dealing with regulators ===\nWhen Uber was led by Travis Kalanick, Uber took an aggressive strategy in dealing with obstacles, including regulators.",
      "In 2014, Kalanick said \"You have to have what I call principled confrontation.\"",
      "Uber's strategy was generally to commence operations in a city, then, if it faced regulatory opposition, Uber mobilized public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbyists, to change regulations.In 2014, while in the midst of a regulatory battle, Portland, Oregon's transportation commissioner called Uber management \"a bunch of thugs\".In June 2014, Uber distributed to its riders the personal contact information of a commissioner in Virginia who opposed the company and told riders to flood his inbox with complaints.In November 2017, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi dropped the \"win at all costs\" strategy and implemented new values for the company, including \"we do the right thing\".",
      "=== Alleged cancellation of ride requests to disrupt competitors ===\nUber issued an apology on January 24, 2014, after documents were leaked to Valleywag and TechCrunch saying that, earlier in the month, Uber employees in New York City deliberately ordered rides from Gett, a competitor, only to cancel them later.",
      "The purpose of the fake orders was two-fold: wasting drivers' time to obstruct legitimate customers from securing a car, and offering drivers incentives—including cash—to join Uber.",
      "==== Operation SLOG plan to disrupt Lyft ====\nFollowing Lyft's expansion into New York City in July 2014, Uber, with the assistance of TargetCW, a San Diego, California-based employment agency, sent emails offering a \"huge commission opportunity\" to several contractors based on the \"personal hustle\" of the participants.",
      "Those who responded to the solicitation were offered a meeting with Uber marketing managers who attempted to create a \"street team\" to gather intelligence about Lyft's launch plans in New York City and recruit their drivers to Uber.",
      "Recruits were given 2 Uber-branded iPhones (one a backup in case the person was identified by Lyft) and a series of valid credit card numbers to create dummy Lyft accounts.",
      "Participants were also required to sign non-disclosure agreements.In August 2014, Lyft reported that 177 Uber employees had ordered and canceled approximately 5,560 Lyft rides since October 2013, and that it had found links to Uber recruiters by cross-referencing the phone numbers involved.",
      "The report identified one Lyft passenger who canceled 300 rides from May 26 to June 10, 2014, and who was identified as an Uber recruiter by 7 different Lyft drivers.",
      "Uber did not apologize, but suggested that the recruitment attempts were possibly independent parties trying to make money.",
      "=== Evasion of law enforcement operations ===\n\n\n==== Greyball ====\nUber developed an internal software tool called Greyball, which uses data collected from the Uber mobile app other means, to avoid giving rides to certain individuals.",
      "The tool was used starting in 2014.",
      "By showing \"ghost cars\" driven by fake drivers to the targeted individuals in the Uber mobile app, and by giving real drivers a means to cancel rides requested by those individuals, Uber was able to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service is illegal.",
      "Investigative journalism by The New York Times and the resulting report, published on March 3, 2017, made public Uber's use of Greyball since 2014, describing it as a way to evade city code enforcement officials in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China.",
      "At first, in response to the report, Uber stated that Greyball was designed to deny rides to users who violate Uber's terms of service, including those involved in sting operations.",
      "According to Uber, Greyball can \"hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version\".",
      "Uber reportedly used Greyball to identify government officials through factors such as whether a user frequently opens the app near government offices, a review of social media profiles by Uber employees to identify law enforcement personnel, and the credit cards associated with the Uber account.On March 6, 2017, the City of Portland, Oregon announced an investigation into whether Uber had used its Greyball software tool to obstruct the enforcement of city regulations.",
      "The investigation by the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) found that: \"Uber used Greyball software to intentionally evade PBOT’s officers from December 5 to December 19, 2014 and deny 29 separate ride requests by PBOT enforcement officers.\"}}",
      "Following the release of the audit, Portland's commissioner of police suggested that the city subpoena Uber to force the company to turn over information on how Uber used software to evade regulatory officials.On March 8, 2017, Uber admitted that it had used Greyball to thwart government regulators and pledged to stop using the service for that purpose.In May 2017, the United States Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into Uber's use of Greyball to avoid local law enforcement operations.",
      "==== Ripley ====\nAfter a police raid in Uber's Brussels office, a January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that \"Uber routinely used Ripley to thwart police raids in foreign countries.\"",
      "Developed as a type of secret \"panic button\" system, initially called \"unexpected visitor protocol\", then nicknamed \"Ripley\", to disrupt government raids on Uber's offices by locking, shutting off, and changing passwords on staff computers upon a raid; Uber likely used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.",
      "=== User privacy and data breaches ===\n\n\n==== God view ====\nOn November 19, 2014, then U.S.",
      "Senator Al Franken, Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, sent a letter to Kalanick regarding privacy.",
      "Concerns were raised about internal misuse of the company's data, in particular the ability of Uber staff to track the movements of its customers, known as \"God View\".",
      "In 2011, a venture capitalist disclosed that Uber staff members were using the function to track journalists and politicians as well as using the feature recreationally.",
      "Staff members viewed being tracked by Uber as a positive reflection on the subject's character.",
      "An Uber job interviewee said that he was given unrestricted access to Uber's customer tracking function as part of the interview process, and that he retained that access for several hours after the interview ended.",
      "==== Data breaches ====\nOn February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than 9 months earlier.",
      "Names and license plate information of approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed.",
      "Uber discovered this leak in September 2014 but waited more than 5 months to notify the affected people.An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach disclosed personal information on 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers—including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and driving license information.",
      "Using employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a \"credential stuffing\" method), attackers gained access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber developers.",
      "The hackers subsequently located credentials for the company's Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were therefore able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets.",
      "Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data.",
      "The company was subsequently criticized for concealing the loss of data.",
      "CEO Dara Khosrowshahi apologized.",
      "Uber's British divisions were fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the Information Commissioner's Office.In September 2018, Uber settled with the Federal Trade Commission for $148 million and admitted that its claim that internal access to consumers' personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false.",
      "Uber also stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data.",
      "It was the largest multi-state settlement related to a data breach.",
      "=== Safety concerns ===\nIt is unclear if Uber is less or more safe than taxicabs, as major cities don't have much data on taxi-related incidents.",
      "==== Allegations of inadequate background checks and vetting of drivers ====\nConcerns regarding Uber's background checks were raised after reports of sexual abuse of passengers by Uber drivers.",
      "In February 2016, Uber was criticized following the 2016 Kalamazoo shootings, a shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Michigan that left six people dead and two wounded.",
      "It was committed by Jason Dalton, who was driving for Uber while conducting the shooting.",
      "During the ensuing seven-hour manhunt, authorities believe that Dalton continued to drive and accept fares.",
      "Uber was aware of issues with Dalton's driving skills, having received multiple complaints, though critics agree that Dalton would not have raised any red flags since he did not have a criminal record.In November 2017, The Colorado Public Utilities Commission fined Uber $8.9 million after discovering that 57 drivers in the state had violations in their background checks.",

      "=== Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017) ===\nOn February 20, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler stated that she was subjected to sexual harassment by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident.",
      "Kalanick was reportedly aware of the harassment issues.CTO Thuan Pham was alleged to have had knowledge of and to ignore Susan Fowler's sexual harassment allegations; however, investigations by TheInformation and Buzzfeed showed this to not be the case, allowing Pham to keep his job.Uber hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate the claims.",
      "Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, also oversaw the investigation.",
      "Fowler likened Uber's culture to A Game of Thrones, in which rivals vie for the throne the same way Uber employees were encouraged to vie for power and aggression and betrayal was common.",
      "On February 20, 2017, Kalanick led a meeting with employees that was described by the participants as honest and raw.On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after it came to light that he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he was the Vice President of Google Search.On June 6, 2017, Uber announced that it fired over 20 employees as a result of the investigation.",
      "On June 13, 2017, Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence from Uber.",
      "On June 20, 2017, after multiple shareholders reportedly demanded his resignation, Kalanick resigned as CEO.",
      "==== Scandals and departure of Emil Michael ====\nAt a private dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice president of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to \"dig up dirt\" on the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber.",
      "Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising.",
      "Michael issued a public apology and apologized to Lacy in a personal email, claiming that Uber would never actually undertake the plan.",
      "Several journalists deleted their Uber apps.",
      "After several additional scandals involving Emil Michael, including an escort-karaoke bar scandal in Seoul and the questioning of the medical records of a rape victim in India, he left the company in June 2017 when Kalanick, who reportedly was protecting Michael, resigned.",

      "Venture capital (VC) is a type of private equity, a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small, early-stage, emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential, or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, or both).",
      "Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake, in the companies they invest in.",
      "Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful.",
      "Because startups face high uncertainty, VC investments do have high rates of failure.",
      "The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology or biotechnology.",
      "The typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial \"seed funding\" round.",
      "The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the Series A round.",
      "Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual \"exit\" event, such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering (IPO) or doing a merger and acquisition (also known as a \"trade sale\") of the company.",
      "In addition to Angel investing, equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering.",
      "In exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value).",
      "Start-ups like Uber, Airbnb, Flipkart, Xiaomi & Didi Chuxing are highly valued startups, commonly known as unicorns, where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm's executives on its business model and marketing strategies.",
      "Venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries, so that they can progress and develop.",
      "This institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance, technical expertise, mentoring, marketing \"know-how\", and business models.",
      "Once integrated into the business network, these firms are more likely to succeed, as they become \"nodes\" in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain.",
      "However, venture capitalists' decisions are often biased, exhibiting for instance overconfidence and illusion of control, much like entrepreneurial decisions in general.",
      "== History ==\nA startup may be defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment.",
      "With few exceptions, private equity in the first half of the 20th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families.",
      "The Wallenbergs, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Rockefellers, and Warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century.",
      "In 1938, Laurance S. Rockefeller helped finance the creation of both Eastern Air Lines and Douglas Aircraft, and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies.",
      "Eric M. Warburg founded E.M. Warburg & Co. in 1938, which would ultimately become Warburg Pincus, with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital.",
      "The Wallenberg family started Investor AB in 1916 in Sweden and were early investors in several Swedish companies such as ABB, Atlas Copco, Ericsson, etc.",
      "in the first half of the 20th century.",
      "(History of venture capital)\n\n\n=== Origins of modern private equity ===\nBefore World War II (1939–1945), money orders (originally known as \"development capital\") remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families.",
      "Only after 1945 did \"true\" private equity investments begin to emerge, notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in 1946: American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC) and J.H.",
      "Whitney & Company.Georges Doriot, the \"father of venture capitalism\" (and former assistant dean of Harvard Business School), founded the graduate business school  INSEAD in 1957.",
      "Along with Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton (former president of MIT), Doriot founded ARDC in 1946 to encourage private-sector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from World War II.",
      "ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families, although it had several notable investment successes as well.",
      "ARDC is credited with the first trick when its 1957 investment of $70,000 in Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) would be valued at over $355 million after the company's initial public offering in 1968 (representing a return of over 1200 times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of 101%).Former employees of ARDC went on to establish several prominent venture-capital firms including Greylock Partners (founded in 1965 by Charlie Waite and Bill Elfers) and Morgan, Holland Ventures, the predecessor of Flagship Ventures (founded in 1982 by James Morgan).",
      "ARDC continued investing until 1971, when Doriot retired.",
      "In 1972 Doriot merged ARDC with Textron after having invested in over 150 companies.",
      "John Hay Whitney (1904–1982) and his partner Benno Schmidt (1913–1999) founded J.H.",
      "Whitney & Company in 1946.",
      "Whitney had been investing since the 1930s, founding Pioneer Pictures in 1933 and acquiring a 15% interest in Technicolor Corporation with his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney.",
      "Florida Foods Corporation proved Whitney's most famous investment.",
      "The company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to American soldiers, later known as Minute Maid orange juice and was sold to The Coca-Cola Company in 1960.",
      "J.H.",
      "Whitney & Company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised $750 million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in 2005.",
      "=== Early venture capital and the growth of Silicon Valley ===\n\nOne of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.",
      "The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to license private \"Small Business Investment Companies\" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States.During the 1950s, putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to complete the transaction.",
      "It was a business that was growing very rapidly, and as the business grew, the transactions grew exponentially.During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies.",
      "More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology.",
      "As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance.",
      "An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962 by William Henry Draper III and Franklin P. Johnson, Jr.",
      "In 1965, Sutter Hill Ventures acquired the portfolio of Draper and Johnson as a founding action.",
      "Bill Draper and Paul Wythes were the founders, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company at that time.",
      "It is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup is Fairchild Semiconductor (which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit), funded in 1959 by what would later become Venrock Associates.",
      "Venrock was founded in 1969 by Laurance S. Rockefeller, the fourth of John D. Rockefeller's six children, as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments.",
      "It was also in the 1960s that the common form of private equity fund, still in use today, emerged.",
      "Private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors, who were passive limited partners, put up the capital.",
      "The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0–2.5% and a carried interest typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.",
      "The growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972.",
      "Located in Menlo Park, CA, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies.Throughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms.",
      "In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).",
      "The NVCA was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry.",
      "Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.",
      "It was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million.",
      "With the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies.",
      "In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain restrictions of the ERISA, under the \"prudent man rule\", thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.",
      "=== 1980s ===\nThe public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple Inc., Genentech) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms.",
      "From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major \"home run.\"",
      "The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.The growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time.",
      "In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors affected returns.",
      "The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987, and foreign corporations, particularly from Japan and Korea, flooded early-stage companies with capital.In response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including General Electric and Paine Webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units.",
      "Additionally, venture capital units within Chemical Bank and Continental Illinois National Bank, among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies.",
      "Even industry founders J.H.",
      "Whitney & Company and Warburg Pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments.",
      "=== Venture capital boom and the Internet Bubble ===\nBy the end of the 1980s, venture capital returns were relatively low, particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins, due in part to the competition for hot startups, excess supply of IPOs and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers.",
      "Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.",
      "After a shakeout of venture capital managers, the more successful firms retrenched, focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments.",
      "Results would begin to turn very attractive, successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the 1990s.",
      "Yale School of Management Professor Andrew Metrick refers to these first 15 years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in 1980 as the \"pre-boom period\" in anticipation of the boom that would begin in 1995 and last through the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000.The late 1990s were a boom time for venture capital, as firms on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and Silicon Valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent Internet and other computer technologies.",
      "Initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance, and venture firms were reaping large returns.",
      "=== Private equity crash ===\n\nThe Nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed.",
      "Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off large proportions of their investments, and many funds were significantly \"under water\" (the values of the fund's investments were below the amount of capital invested).",
      "Venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market.",
      "By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity.",
      "Nevertheless, PricewaterhouseCoopers' MoneyTree Survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005.",
      "Although the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995.",
      "As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004.",
      "The revival of an Internet-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment.",
      "However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.",
      "Venture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the dot-com bubble), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2% decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak.",
      "== Funding ==\nObtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan.",
      "Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business.",
      "Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business.",
      "The return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business.",
      "This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist \"exits\" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.",
      "Venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in, with a Stanford survey of venture capitalists revealing that 100 companies were considered for every company receiving financing.",
      "Ventures receiving financing must demonstrate an excellent management team, a large potential market, and most importantly high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.",
      "Because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment.",
      "Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an IPO stage when valuations are favourable.",
      "Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development:\nIdea generation;\nStart-up;\nRamp up; and\nExitBecause there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as \"Speed Venturing\", which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting.",
      "In addition, some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors.This need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front capital requirements, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt.",
      "That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven.",
      "In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields.",
      "If a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.",
      "=== Financing stages ===\nThere are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in Venture Capital, that roughly correspond to these stages of a company's development.",
      "Seed funding: The earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea, often provided by angel investors.",
      "Equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding.",
      "Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development\nGrowth  (Series A round): Early sales and manufacturing funds.",
      "This is typically where VCs come in.",
      "Series A can be thought of as the first institutional round.",
      "Subsequent investment rounds are called Series B, Series C and so on.",
      "This is where most companies will have the most growth.",
      "Second-Round: Working capital for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning a profit.",
      "This can also be called Series B round and so on.",
      "Expansion: Also called Mezzanine financing, this is expansion money for a newly profitable company\nExit of venture capitalist: VCs can exit through secondary sale or an IPO or an acquisition.",
      "Early stage VCs may exit in later rounds when new investors (VCs or Private Equity investors) buy the shares of existing investors.",
      "Sometimes a company very close to an IPO may allow some VCs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the IPO.",
      "Bridge Financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full VC rounds.",
      "The objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate.Between the first round and the fourth round, venture-backed companies may also seek to take venture debt.",
      "== Firms and funds ==\n\n\n=== Venture capitalists ===\nA venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments, and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments.",
      "A venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle (in the United States, often an LP or LLC) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans.",
      "These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.",
      "A core skill within VC is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage.",
      "By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns.",
      "Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company.",
      "As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies.",
      "By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.",
      "=== Structure ===\nVenture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships, the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised.",
      "Venture capital firms in the United States may also be structured as limited liability companies, in which case the firm's managers are known as managing members.",
      "Investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners.",
      "This constituency comprises both high-net-worth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital, such as state and private pension funds, university financial endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and pooled investment vehicles, called funds of funds.",
      "=== Types ===\nVenture capitalist firms differ in their motivations and approaches.",
      "There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.",
      "Venture capital funds are generally three in types:\n1.",
      "Angel investors \n2.",
      "Financial VCs \n3.",
      "Strategic VCs\nSome of the factors that influence VC decisions include:\n\nBusiness situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new, disruptive ideas, or fledgling companies.",
      "Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.",
      "Some invest solely in certain industries.",
      "Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.",
      "VC expectations can often vary.",
      "Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth.",
      "The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next.",
      "=== Roles ===\nWithin the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as \"venture capitalists\" or \"VCs\".",
      "Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background.",
      "Venture capitalists with an operational background (operating partner) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants.",
      "Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience.",
      "Although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm, other positions at venture capital firms include:\n\n\n=== Structure of the funds ===\nMost venture capital funds have a fixed life of 10 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity.",
      "The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio.",
      "This model was pioneered by successful funds in Silicon Valley through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.",
      "In such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently \"called down\" by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments.",
      "There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a capital call.",
      "It can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund.",
      "At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins.",
      "Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised.",
      "The vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison.",
      "This shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them.",
      "From investors' point of view, funds can be: (1) traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) asymmetric—where different investors have different terms.",
      "Typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where there's an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors.",
      "=== Compensation ===\n\nVenture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest (often referred to as a \"two and 20\" arrangement):\n\nBecause a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged.",
      "Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.",
      "=== Alternatives ===\nBecause of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors, who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur.",
      "Additionally, entrepreneurs may seek alternative financing, such as revenue-based financing, to avoid giving up equity ownership in the business.",
      "Furthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a start-up company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services.",
      "To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors.",
      "This practice is called \"bootstrapping\".",
      "Equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital.",
      "Traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations.",
      "While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost.",
      "Some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding, such as those listed at Comparison of crowd funding services.",
      "One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model.",
      "The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and return on investment of many VC funds have been low or negative.In Europe and India, Media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding.",
      "Media for equity investors are able to supply start-ups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity.",
      "In Europe, an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment; their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding, mergers and acquisition, or other exit strategy.In industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure, businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth.",
      "Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries.",
      "Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV (special purpose vehicle): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.",
      "In addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.Law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it.Other forms include venture resources that seek to provide non-monetary support to launch a new venture.",
      "== Societal impact ==\nVenture capital is also associated with job creation (accounting for 2% of US GDP), the knowledge economy, and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography.",
      "Every year, there are nearly 2 million businesses created in the US, and 600–800 get venture capital funding.",
      "According to the National Venture Capital Association, 11% of private sector jobs come from venture-backed companies and venture-backed revenue accounts for 21% of US GDP.Babson College's Diana Report found that the number of women partners in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014.",
      "The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male chief executives, and that businesses with all-male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman.",
      "Currently, about 3 percent of all venture capital is going to woman-led companies.",
      "More than 75% of VC firms in the US did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed.",
      "It was found that a greater fraction of VC firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies.",
      "In 2017 only 2.2% of all VC funding went to female founders.For comparison, a UC Davis study focusing on large public companies in California found 49.5% with at least one female board seat.",
      "When the latter results were published, some San Jose Mercury News readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause.",
      "In a follow-up Newsweek article, Nina Burleigh asked \"Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?\"",
      "== Geographical differences ==\nVenture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, and American firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in American companies.",
      "However, increasingly, non-US venture investment is growing, and the number and size of non-US venture capitalists have been expanding.",
      "Venture capital has been used as a tool for economic development in a variety of developing regions.",
      "In many of these regions, with less developed financial sectors, venture capital plays a role in facilitating access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which in most cases would not qualify for receiving bank loans.",
      "In the year of 2008, while VC funding were still majorly dominated by U.S. money ($28.8 billion invested in over 2550 deals in 2008), compared to international fund investments ($13.4 billion invested elsewhere), there has been an average 5% growth in the venture capital deals outside the US, mainly in China and Europe.",
      "Geographical differences can be significant.",
      "For instance, in the UK, 4% of British investment goes to venture capital, compared to about 33% in the U.S.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nVenture capitalists invested some $29.1 billion in 3,752 deals in the U.S. through the fourth quarter of 2011, according to a report by the National Venture Capital Association.",
      "The same numbers for all of 2010 were $23.4 billion in 3,496 deals.According to a report by Dow Jones VentureSource, venture capital funding fell to $6.4 billion in the US in the  first quarter of 2013, an 11.8% drop from the first quarter of 2012, and a 20.8% decline from 2011.",

      "As it has very little natural resources and, historically has been forced to build its economy on knowledge-based industries, its VC industry has rapidly developed, and nowadays has about 70 active venture capital funds, of which 14 international VCs with Israeli offices, and additional 220 international funds which actively invest in Israel.",
      "In addition, as of 2010, Israel led the world in venture capital invested per capita.",
      "Israel attracted $170 per person compared to $75 in the USA.",

      "The basic incentive available to any Canadian corporation performing R&D is a refundable tax credit that is equal to 20% of \"qualifying\" R&D expenditures (labour, material, R&D contracts, and R&D equipment).",
      "An enhanced 35% refundable tax credit of available to certain (i.e.",
      "small) Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs).",
      "Because the CCPC rules require a minimum of 50% Canadian ownership in the company performing R&D, foreign investors who would like to benefit from the larger 35% tax credit must accept minority position in the company, which might not be desirable.",
      "The SR&ED program does not restrict the export of any technology or intellectual property that may have been developed with the benefit of SR&ED tax incentives.",
      "Canada also has a fairly unusual form of venture capital generation in its Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCC).",
      "These funds, also known as Retail Venture Capital or Labour Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIF), are generally sponsored by labor unions and offer tax breaks from government to encourage retail investors to purchase the funds.",

      "These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members.",
      "These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time.",

      "Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anti-competitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.Many U.S. states in the 21st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel Amazon.com and other e-commerce retailers to collect state and local sales taxes from its customers.",
      "Amazon.com originally collected sales tax only from five states as of 2011, but as of April 2017, Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a state sales tax and in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n=== Income taxes ===\nAmazon paid no federal income taxes in the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, and actually got tax refunds worth millions of dollars, despite recording several billion dollars in profits each year.",

      "=== Comments by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders ===\nIn early 2018, President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon's use of the United States Postal Service and its prices for the delivery of packages, stating, \"I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\" Trump tweeted.",
      "\"Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne [sic] by the American Taxpayer.\"",
      "Amazon's shares fell by 6 percent as a result of Trump's comments.",
      "Shepard Smith of Fox News disputed Trump's claims and pointed to evidence that the USPS was offering below-market prices to all customers with no advantage to Amazon.",
      "However, analyst Tom Forte pointed to the fact that Amazon's payments to the USPS are not made public and that their contract has a reputation for being \"a sweetheart deal\".Throughout the summer of 2018, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Amazon's wages and working conditions in a series of YouTube videos and media appearances.",
      "He also pointed to the fact that Amazon had paid no federal income tax in the previous year.",

      "=== Working conditions ===\nAmazon has attracted widespread criticism for poor working conditions by both current employees and former employees, as well as the media and politicians.",
      "In 2011, it was publicized that at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse, workers had to carry out work in 100 °F (38 °C) heat, resulting in employees becoming extremely uncomfortable and suffering from dehydration and collapse.",

      "Amazon's initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees.",
      "The company eventually installed air conditioning at the warehouse.Some workers, \"pickers\", who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner \"picking\" customer orders can walk up to 15 miles during their workday and if they fall behind on their targets, they can be reprimanded.",
      "The handheld scanners give real-time information to the employee on how quickly or slowly they are working; the scanners also serve to allow Team Leads and Area Managers to track the specific locations of employees and how much \"idle time\" they gain when not working.In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana Löbl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of Bad Hersfeld in the German state of Hessen.",
      "The report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards, themselves being employed by a third party company, who apparently either had a neo-Nazi background or deliberately dressed in neo-Nazi apparel and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centers.",
      "The third party security company involved was delisted by Amazon as a business contact shortly after that report.In March 2015, it was reported in The Verge that Amazon will be removing non-compete clauses of 18 months in length from its US employment contracts for hourly-paid workers, after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from finding other work.",
      "Even short-term temporary workers have to sign contracts that prohibit them from working at any company where they would \"directly or indirectly\" support any good or service that competes with those they helped support at Amazon, for 18 months after leaving Amazon, even if they are fired or made redundant.A 2015 front-page article in The New York Times profiled several former Amazon employees who together described a \"bruising\" workplace culture in which workers with illness or other personal crises were pushed out or unfairly evaluated.",
      "Bezos responded by writing a Sunday memo to employees, in which he disputed the Times's account of \"shockingly callous management practices\" that he said would never be tolerated at the company.In an effort to boost employee morale, on November 2, 2015, Amazon announced that it would be extending six weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers.",
      "This change includes birth parents and adoptive parents and can be applied in conjunction with existing maternity leave and medical leave for new mothers.In mid-2018, investigations by journalists and media outlets such as The Guardian reported poor working conditions at Amazon's fulfillment centers.",
      "Later in 2018, another article exposed poor working conditions for Amazon's delivery drivers.In response to criticism that Amazon doesn't pay its workers a livable wage, Jeff Bezos announced beginning November 1, 2018, all U.S. and U.K. Amazon employees will earn a $15 an hour minimum wage.",
      "Amazon will also lobby to make $15 an hour the federal minimum wage.",
      "At the same time, Amazon also eliminated stock awards and bonuses for hourly employees.On Black Friday 2018, Amazon warehouse workers in several European countries, including Italy, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, went on strike to protest inhumane working conditions and low pay.The Daily Beast reported in March 2019 that emergency services responded to 189 calls from 46 Amazon warehouses in 17 states between the years 2013 and 2018, all relating to suicidal employees.",
      "The workers attributed their mental breakdowns to employer-imposed social isolation, aggressive surveillance, and the hurried and dangerous working conditions at these fulfillment centers.",
      "One former employee told The Daily Beast \"It's this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence.\"",
      "=== Conflict of interest with the CIA and DOD ===\nIn 2013, Amazon secured a US$600 million contract with the CIA, which poses a potential conflict of interest involving the Bezos-owned The Washington Post and his newspaper's coverage of the CIA.",
      "Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, \"It's a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.\"",
      "This was later followed by a US$10 billion contract with the Department of Defence.",
      "=== Seattle head tax and houselessness services ===\nIn May 2018, Amazon threatened the Seattle City Council over an employee head tax proposal that would have funded houselessness services and low-income housing.",

      "=== Nashville Operations Center of Excellence ===\nThe incentives given by the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County to Amazon for their new Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville Yards, a site owned by developer Southwest Value Partners, have been controversial, including the decision by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development to keep the full extent of the agreement secret.",
      "The incentives include \"$102 million in combined grants and tax credits for a scaled-down Amazon office building\" as well as \"a $65 million cash grant for capital expenditures\" in exchange for the creation of 5,000 jobs over seven years.The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government called for more transparency.",
      "Another local organization known as the People's Alliance for Transit, Housing, and Employment (PATHE) suggested no public money should be given to Amazon; instead, it should be spent on building more public housing for the working poor and the homeless and investing in more public transportation for Nashvillians.",

      "On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"",
      "Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".In January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\"",
      "YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.",
      "Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement, but began being implemented in 2019.",
      "=== Child protection ===\n\nIn 2017, YouTube was associated with several controversies related to child safety.",
      "During Q2, the owners of popular channel DaddyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse.",
      "Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.Later that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views.",
      "The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.",
      "On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content.",
      "Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters.",
      "As part as a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults.",
      "Most notably, the company removed Toy Freaks, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.",
      "According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.In January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as, for example, the Tide Pod Challenge), and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.On February 28, 2019, YouTube banned comments on all videos of children with exceptions being given to \"trusted partners\" who would be \"required to actively moderate their comments\".",
      "The ban mainly targets videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics.",
      "The ban was created to combat the rise of child predators and pedophiles that create content to harm children in ways ranging from damaging mental health and encouraging self harm to encouraging sexual behavior.",
      "==== Child exploitation by pedophiles ====\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children – often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics – were attracting comments from pedophiles and circulating on the dark web, with predators finding the videos by typing in certain keywords in Russian.",
      "As a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.",
      "In December 2018, The Times found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting sexualised poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.",
      "After a reporter flagged the videos in question, only half were removed.",
      "The rest were removed only after The Times contacted YouTube's PR department.In February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.",
      "Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions, or otherwise making indecent remarks.",
      "In some cases, other users had reuploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.",
      "A spokesperson explained that \"any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube.",
      "There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"",
      "Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.",
      "Subsequently, YouTube representatives have stated that as a further precaution, they are proactively blocking ads on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments, thus preventing them from being monetized.",
      "YouTube stated they were aware this may flag videos that have not drawn offensive comments, and are only placing such ad-blocks on specific videos rather than across entire channels, and that this was only a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.",
      "A further action taken by YouTube has been to flag channels that predominately feature children and preemptively disable their comments sections but otherwise not removing their monetization; affected channels can request comments to be re-enabled, but YouTube stated that channel owners will then be responsible for moderating comments.",
      "YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.A related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in a number of prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game Pokémon Go (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and Club Penguin.",
      "YouTube apologized for the errors, and reinstated the affected videos.",
      "Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019.",
      "YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.",
      "=== User comments ===\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content.",
      "In 2006, Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom.",
      "Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".",
      "The Guardian in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:\nJuvenile, aggressive, misspelled, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance – with the occasional burst of wit shining through.",
      "In September 2008, The Daily Telegraph commented that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".",
      "The Huffington Post noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos.",
      "The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.",
      "The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.",
      "In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\"",
      "on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.",
      "The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.",
      "Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system\".",
      "In the same article Melvin goes on to say:\nPerhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.",
      "Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation.",
      "Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot?",
      "The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.",
      "On July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.",
      "Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam.",
      "They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.",
      "=== View counts ===\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts.",
      "This was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.",
      "On August 5, 2015, YouTube removed the feature which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.",
      "YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.",
      "=== Other algorithm misfires ===\nIn 2018, Youtube introduced an a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.",
      "In the wake of the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by Youtube' system automatically with an Encyclopedia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks.",
      "Several users complained to Youtube about this inappropriate connection.",
      "Youtube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.",
      "== Censorship and filtering ==\n\nAs of 2018, China and North Korea permanently block accessing YouTube, while Iran blocks YouTube on only one internet service provider.",
      "YouTube was blocked in Uzbekistan in October 2018 for unknown reasons.",
      "Access to Facebook had been blocked a month earlier.",
      "People in the country rely on virtual private network software to circumvent the blockage.",
      "On January 15, it was reported that the blockage had been repealed, but it lasted only for 6-7 hours.Governments block YouTube for a variety of reasons, including:\nLimiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.",
      "Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g.",
      "in North Korea), government (e.g.",
      "in China) or its actions (e.g.",
      "in Morocco), government officials (e.g.",
      "in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g.",
      "in Pakistan).",
      "Violations of national laws, including copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g.",
      "in Germany), violations of hate speech, ethics, or morality-based laws, e.g.",
      "in Iran, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth, which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".",
      "Reducing distractions at work or school, e.g.",
      "in Australia.",
      "Reducing the amount of network bandwidth used.In some countries, YouTube is completely blocked, either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries.",
      "In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked.",
      "In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.",
      "Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.Several countries have previously blocked access to YouTube:\n\nMorocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's actions in Western Sahara.",
      "YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after Maroc Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".",
      "Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.",
      "In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.",
      "During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.",
      "In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"",
      "Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.",
      "This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries.",
      "On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.",
      "Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.",
      "In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".",
      "The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.",
